Analysis


The pilot and technologists were experienced in working together as a team. When they arrived at the hydrometric site and found the intended landing site covered with water and ice, they had to formulate an alternate plan to accomplish the project.


The pilot assessed the ice surface characteristics in the bay and judged that he could drop the men off safely from a hover, while maintaining lift on the main rotor. Although the indications on the surface appeared favourable, there was no reliable means to determine the ice thickness and strength from the air. After the technologists exited the helicopter and checked the ice, they signalled the pilot, which reinforced his assessment of the ice condition, and he decided to shut down.


The load-bearing capability of the ice was exceeded when the pilot set the full weight of the helicopter on the ice in preparation for shutdown, and the two technologists moved to the outside of the left rear door of the helicopter to unload their equipment. The small stream feeding into the bay likely had a detrimental effect on the ice thickness and quality.



Findings


The pilot was certified and qualified for the flight in accordance with existing regulations. Records indicate that the helicopter was certified, equipped, and maintained in accordance with existing regulations and approved procedures. The ice-covered bay was an alternate drop-off site because the original landing site was under water. The load-bearing strength of the ice was not sufficient to support the total weight of the helicopter, equipment, and personnel. The main rotor blades fractured when they hit the ice, and an outer portion of one of the blades struck one of the technologists. The stream feeding into the bay likely affected the thickness and quality of the ice. The survivors were rescued expeditiously because of the availability of the satellite phone.
