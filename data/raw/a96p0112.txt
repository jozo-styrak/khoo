Analysis


Mechanical malfunction was not considered a likely factor in this accident because no evidence was found of any airframe, engine, or system malfunction or failure prior to impact, and the pilot had given no indication of any problems when he radioed in at 1300.


The aircraft's flight path and altitude prior to the occurrence are not known. The evidence of the aircraft's rather flat attitude relative to the sloped surface of the mountain and the low speed at impact, the short wreckage trail, and the wreckage damage patterns are all consistent with the aircraft stalling and entering an uncontrolled descent to the ground during a turn at a low height from which recovery was not possible. Because there were no witnesses to the accident, it could not be determined why the aircraft stalled and crashed to the ground.



Findings


The pilot was certified and qualified for the flight in accordance with existing regulations. There was no evidence of any airframe, engine, or system malfunction or failure prior to impact. There were moderate to strong winds and reported updrafts in the area at the time of the accident. The aircraft was operating at a density altitude which adversely affected the aircraft's rate-of-climb and turn radius. The aircraft crashed in an uncontrolled, stalled flight condition, probably from a low altitude, for reasons undetermined.
