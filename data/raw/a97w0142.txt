Analysis


It was concluded that the engine stopped when the engine driven fuel pump failed due to the disengagement of the drive shaft splines from the driver gear splines. Because of the suddenness of the failure, the pilot had no warning that a problem existed.


The pilot was transiting at 100 feet agl when the power loss occurred, which reduced the number of landing sites available for an autorotation landing. Stretching his glide to cross a creek resulted in a decrease in rotor rpm, which affected the pilot's ability to reduce the helicopter's forward speed and rate of descent prior to touchdown. As a result, the left skid dug into the ground and the helicopter rolled onto its right side. Many factors play a role in the ability of the pilot to carry out an autorotation without damage to the helicopter. In this case cruising at a higher altitude may have eliminated the need to stretch the glide, and allowed the pilot to maintain rotor rpm to control the landing.



Findings


The engine stopped due to fuel starvation caused by the failure of the engine driven fuel pump. The engine driven fuel pump failed due to excessive wear of the splines of the drive shaft and the driver gear. It could not be determined what caused the excessive wear of the splines. The pilot was flying at an altitude which reduced his choices of landing sites for the autorotation.
