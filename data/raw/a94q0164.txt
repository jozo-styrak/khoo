Analysis


On take-off, the amount of fuel in the right tank was insufficient to supply the engine when the aircraft was in a flight phase other than cruising. During a large part of the flight, therefore, only the left tank was able to supply fuel. Considering that the aircraft consumed at least four gallons of fuel during the flight, there were approximately three gallons of usable fuel remaining in the left tank when the engine stopped. As the descent was made in an extended sideslip to the left, the fuel in the left tank moved away from the outlet port, which was thus uncovered. The engine, no longer being supplied with fuel, stopped shortly thereafter. The altitude at which the engine stopped was insufficient for the pilot either to restart the engine and restore power or to manoeuvre safely to make a forced landing on suitable ground.


In light of the condition of the cabin after the accident and the injuries suffered by the pilot, it is reasonable to assume that the passenger's injuries might have been less serious if he had been secured.



Findings


On take-off, the amount of fuel in the right tank was insufficient to supply the engine when the aircraft was in a flight phase other than cruising. The amount of fuel in the tanks was below the level recommended by the manufacturer for take-off. The engine stopped after an extended sideslip to the left during the descent. The engine stopped at too low an altitude for the pilot to restart the engine or to make a safe forced landing. No pre-impact abnormality that could explain the engine stoppage was observed. The passenger, who did not have a seat or a safety belt, suffered serious injuries to the face.
