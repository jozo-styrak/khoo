Analysis


After an aircraft fire, some items of evidence may be missing due to the necessarily rapid response of on-board personnel and fire-fighters. These persons are properly trained to combat the fire as quickly as possible and prevent it from spreading. In this case, despite the full cooperation of the fire-fighters, several items of evidence were damaged in the response and were not available. Although it was determined that a fire occurred in the baggage compartment, and very probably in flight, the origin of the fire could not be conclusively determined.


However, examination of the passenger baggage established that the baggage selected for analysis contained dangerous goods that are permitted to be carried on board aircraft in the baggage compartment under existing regulations, including a container of hair spray and a container of shaving cream. If these containers had exploded, there is a strong possibility that the consequences could have been more disastrous and that the fire could possibly have spread within the aircraft. However, due to its design, the baggage compartment was able to contain the fire as expected.


To further enhance baggage compartment safety, measures were immediately taken by the company to prevent the baggage compartment lights from coming into contact with baggage.


The following laboratory report was prepared:


LP 188/95 - Fire Examination Fokker F-28, C-FCRI.



Findings


The aircraft was evacuated rapidly and without incident. The baggage contained dangerous goods that are permitted to be carried on board aircraft in the baggage compartment under existing regulations. The fire probably originated in flight. The origin of the fire could not be determined. Due to its design, the baggage compartment was able to contain the fire as expected.
