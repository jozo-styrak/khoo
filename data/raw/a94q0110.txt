Analysis


Throughout almost the whole day, the clouds stayed at a maximum altitude of 300 feet over the les-de-la-Madeleine Airport. The pilot took off from Charlo because he thought that the conditions would improve. The pilot was not, however, authorized to make an approach as the only pilot on board because the measured ceiling of 300 feet was below the alternate minimum of 800 feet published in the CAP for the airport. The pilot put pressure on himself to succeed and satisfy the passengers.


When the aircraft broke out below the cloud layer on the second approach, it was to the left of the centre line of runway 26. The pilot could not identify the runway threshold because of the poor horizontal in-flight visibility at 300 feet above ground level (agl). Furthermore, as the aircraft was to the left of the runway centre line, the fuselage masked the identification of the runway. Moreover, the pilot was disoriented when he saw runway 34 as he was crossing over it. He made a left turn and touched down on the runway that he had identified. During the turn, the poor in-flight visibility at 300 feet did now allow the pilot to manoeuvre to ensure a safe normal landing. Because of where the wheels finally touched down, it was impossible for the pilot to stop the aircraft safely before the end of the runway with only between 200 and 300 feet remaining.



Findings


The weather minima were below those for which the pilot was authorized. The pilot put pressure on himself to satisfy the passengers. Because the horizontal in-flight visibility at 300 feet agl was poor, the pilot could not positively identify runway 26 and could not manoeuvre in order to ensure a safe normal landing on runway 34. The pilot landed the aircraft on the last 200 to 300 feet of runway 34. The remaining runway length was insufficient for the pilot to avert overshooting the runway.
