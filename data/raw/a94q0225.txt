Analysis


Meteorological conditions indicate that the wind was gusting from the left side of the runway. On landing, the aircraft touched down hard, undoubtedly with some crab, and bounced a considerable distance before touching down a second time, causing the nosewheel to fail.


The nosewheel failed in overload as a result of lateral forces originating from the right side, and the crew was unable to maintain directional control of the aircraft.


The following laboratory report was completed:


LP 07/95 - Nose Landing-Gear Fork Analysis.



Findings


There were strong gusts of wind at the time of the occurrence. The wind was blowing across the runway at a 60-degree angle. The aircraft bounced on initial contact with the frozen surface of the short runway. The nosewheel piston failed in overload from right to left.
