Analysis


The damage to the ultralight was attributed to the impact with the ground. There is no indication that the aircraft experienced a malfunction before the accident. The tests performed on the parts sent to the TSB Engineering Branch Laboratory ruled out the possibility of a structure break-up in flight.


The passengers who boarded the ultralight aircraft were to receive training as part of a familiarization flight. Such ultralight flights are neither supervised nor defined as they are for an aeroplane. It is therefore hard to distinguish between a familiarization flight and a simple ultralight tour.


The prevailing conditions in terms of winds and terrain profile were conducive to low-level mechanical turbulence. The pilot probably encountered turbulence conditions that he was unable to manage, resulting in loss of control of the aircraft.


The following laboratory report was completed:



Findings as to Causes and Contributing Factors


The winds were blowing at 9 to 18 knots, possibly causing low-level mechanical turbulence. The pilot probably encountered turbulence conditions that could have caused a loss of control.



Other Findings


A familiarization flight is neither defined nor supervised for ultralights. It is hard in this kind of operation to distinguish between a so-called familiarization flight and an ultralight tour.
