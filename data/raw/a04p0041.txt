Analysis


Examination of the recovered sections of the aircraft did not reveal any mechanical failures that would be likely to cause a loss of control, although corrosion was noted throughout the aircraft. It would appear that the aircraft had been reconfigured for cruise flight after the touch-and-go landing, in that, at impact, the flaps were retracted and the landing gear was up. The aircraft was not configured for an intentional landing, nor was the engine power reduced to a level consistent with an attempted touchdown.


When all available information is taken into account, it is concluded that pilot incapacitation was the most likely cause for the loss of control and collision with the water.



Findings as to Causes and Contributing Factors


It is most likely that the pilot became incapacitated while piloting the aircraft, resulting in a loss of control and collision with the water.



Other Findings


Although current pilot medical examinations are intended to ensure that pilots are medically safe to fly, a rational screening policy cannot detect every risk factor that could result in incapacitation.
