Analysis


The pilot reported that he heard the low rotor rpm horn at the same time he felt the "bump" in the cyclic control. This sensation in the cyclic control is consistent with the main rotor striking the tree. When the blade struck the tree, the main rotor rpm would have slowed down briefly and caused the low rotor horn to activate momentarily.


The pilot was able to increase power to move away from the staging area indicating that the engine was developing power and that the low rotor horn did not activate as a result of a loss of engine power prior to the tree strike.



Findings


The main rotor blades struck a tree. The tree was behind the helicopter and out of the pilot's line of sight. The rotor and engine damage were consistent with the events following a blade strike. The airframe damage was the result of a hard landing.
