Analysis


The wreckage distribution, impact angle, and lack of forward speed indicate that the aircraft was in a stalled condition when it struck the ground. Because of the pilot's familiarity with the aircraft, it would seem unlikely that he would stall the aircraft on climb out, unless something unexpected occurred.


Based on there being no evidence of fuel found at the accident site or during the detailed examination of the engine, and the lack of engine noise as the aircraft descended, it is concluded that the engine stopped because of fuel exhaustion during the climb. The nose-high attitude of the aircraft, along with the characteristic high aerodynamic drag of the biplane would have resulted in a rapid loss of airspeed when engine power was lost. The pilot may have banked the aircraft aggressively to manouevre for a landing on the aerodrome, and the wing stalled. The aircraft was at too low an altitude for the pilot to affect recovery from the stall before the aircraft struck the ground.



Findings


The aircraft was equipped and maintained in accordance with existing regulations and approved procedures. The pilot was certified and qualified to conduct the flight. There was no evidence of fuel found at the accident site or during the examination of the aircraft engine. It was concluded that the aircraft engine stopped because of fuel starvation during the climb at low altitude. The aircraft stalled at too low an altitude for the pilot to effect recovery.
