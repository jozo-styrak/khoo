Analysis


The pilot did not have any recent experience with water take-offs and landings, and he did not meet the ANO requirements to carry passengers on the occurrence flight. When the aircraft struck the boat wake and bounced, the pilot was likely unable to keep the aircraft in a normal take-off attitude. With each successive bounce, the pitch oscillations increased in magnitude until the aircraft plunged nose first into the water and came to an abrupt stop.


If shoulder harnesses had been available and worn by the passengers, the severity of the injuries may have been reduced, or the injuries prevented.



Findings


The aircraft struck the wake of a boat during the take-off run and pitched nose down into the water. Cooks Bay is popular with boaters and large boat wakes are common. This was the pilot's second water take-off, and the first with passengers, since the previous fall. The pilot did not meet the ANO requirements to carry passengers. There were no shoulder harnesses in the aircraft.
