Analysis


A bang, vibrations, and a loss of rotor speed are typical symptoms of a main rotor strike. Although no clearly identifiable rotor strike marks were found on the stumps in the area of the attempted landing site, the marks and the trapped wood fibres on the main rotor blade tip are consistent with a rotor strike, likely against a stump that protruded into the area of the rotor disk.


It is likely that, when the pilot approached the decommissioned road, his attention was focused on evaluating the suitability of the landing surface and he did not recognize that a stump extended into the main rotor disk area. Although the helicopter was airborne, the vibrations and the decaying main rotor speed which resulted from the strike forced the pilot to land immediately. The helicopter touched down on the steep sloping terrain and rolled over.



Findings


The pilot attempted an off-level, hovering landing at an unsuitable site. The main rotor blade likely struck a stump, causing vibrations and the main rotor speed to decay. The pilot was forced to land on steep sloping terrain, which caused the helicopter to roll over. The passengers were not wearing the available shoulder harnesses.
