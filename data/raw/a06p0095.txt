Analysis


There are many indications that the engine was operating normally, making engine failure unlikely as a cause or contributing factor to the accident.


The take-off distance and climb speeds were consistent with the performance indicated in the owner's manual.


The aircraft's CG was near the aft limit and the flight path after take-off was consistent with an aircraft that is aft-heavy and unstable about the pitch axis. The horizontal stabilizer was found trimmed to a position consistent with an aft CG. The turbulent, gusty wind at Prince George and the retraction of the flaps would have exacerbated the unstable condition. As well, the unrestrained cargo may have shifted rearward in flight, moving the CG further aft.


It is concluded that a loss of pitch control, consistent with an aft CG, occurred in gusty and turbulent conditions at a height too low for the pilot to effect recovery. The unrestrained cargo likely struck the pilot during the crash and may have contributed to his injuries.



Findings as to Causes and Contributing Factors


Loss of pitch control, consistent with an aft centre of gravity (CG), occurred in gusty and turbulent conditions at a height too low for the pilot to effect recovery. The cargo was unrestrained, which may have allowed some cargo to shift rearwards during the take-off and climb, resulting in an extremely aft CG.



Finding as to Risk


Unrestrained cargo presents a high risk to aircraft occupants during turbulence and during a crash.
