Analysis


The first officer disembarked at the main terminal, leaving the captain to taxi the aircraft to the south side of the airport. In good weather conditions, this would probably not have been a problem. However, since the captain needed to use the wind screen wipers while manoeuvring, he was required to lean across the cockpit, taking his attention away from his primary task of taxiing the aircraft. The operation of the wind screen wipers was carried out at a critical moment, and he missed the turn onto taxiway Charlie and the do-not-enter signs for Charlie 2.


Calgary Airport Authority, Transport Canada, and NAV CANADA are aware that the Charlie 2 and Charlie intersection is a known confusion area. Numerous meetings and discussions have taken place to try to improve the situation at this intersection.



Findings as to Causes and Contributing Factors


The pilot was distracted from his primary task when he activated the wind screen wipers and inadvertently entered taxiway Charlie 2. The pilot was taxiing without the assistance of a second crew member. The use of reverse thrust caused snow to be blown onto the wind screen, thus requiring the use of the wind screen wipers.
