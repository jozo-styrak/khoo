Analysis


The aircraft damage described by the RCMP divers is typical of damage that occurs when an aircraft has cartwheeled on the water after having struck the water with a wing tip. However, why and in what attitude the aircraft struck the water was not determined. It is probable that the pilot encountered turbulence and lost control of the aircraft during an attempted landing.


It was not determined if the pilot's head injury was the result of him either striking the aircraft or being struck by loose cargo during the crash sequence. It was also not determined if the severity of the pilot's injuries would have been reduced had he been wearing the available shoulder harness.



Findings


The pilot was not wearing the available shoulder harness. The aircraft was maintained in accordance with existing directives. Strong winds known to cause hazardous turbulence were present in the area at the time of the accident. It is probable that the pilot encountered turbulence and lost control of the aircraft during an attempted landing.
