Analysis


The aeroplane appeared to be under control. The engine was likely operating normally; however, its horsepower would have decreased about 23 per cent in the conditions present during the accident flight. The negative effects of the relatively high density altitude would be felt in all facets of the aeroplane's performance. The aeroplane was not loaded as heavily during the flight earlier in the day, and the pilot may not have been aware of the extent to which the high density altitude and wind conditions affected the flight. Also, even the slightest tail wind from the south would considerably increase the distance required to clear the trees at the end of the field. Because of the extra weight on the accident flight, these conditions contributed to the aircraft not attaining an angle of climb sufficient to clear the trees to the north of the airstrip.


The pilot, in attempting to climb over the trees, was likely operating the aeroplane at an angle of attack close to an aerodynamic stall. Because the aeroplane did not reach a height sufficient to fly over the trees, the pilot probably banked the aeroplane to avoid the trees. This manoeuvring would have affected the airflow over the wings, causing the aeroplane to stall at a height from which a recovery was not possible.



Findings


The aircraft was close to its maximum gross take-off weight and had degraded performance because of the relatively high density altitude. As a result, the angle of climb was too shallow to clear the trees at the end the airstrip. The pilot's attempt to manoeuvre to avoid the trees resulted in a stall at an altitude that was too low for the pilot to recover.
