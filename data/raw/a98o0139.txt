Analysis


The information gleaned from the examination of the wreckage indicates that the engine was not developing high power at impact; it is probable that the throttle was positioned at a low power setting.


Damage to the aircraft, the eyewitness account of the last few moments of the flight, and analysis of the wreckage indicate that the aircraft struck the ground at a low forward speed and a high rate of descent, which is consistent with an aircraft in a stalled condition. To recover from a stall, the control column is moved forward commanding down elevator to increase the airspeed and air flow over the wing. The witness marks on the flight control surfaces indicate that, immediately before impact, the ailerons were commanding a left roll, the rudder was deflected fully to the left and the elevators were commanding nose up.


It could not be determined why the aircraft was not recovered from the stall before it struck the ground.



Findings


Records show that the aircraft was operated and maintained in accordance with existing regulations. Records show that the instructor was licensed and qualified to conduct the flight. There was no indication that incapacitation or physiological factors affected the crew's performance. There was no indication of any pre-impact damage to the engine which would have prevented it from developing rated power. There was no indication of malfunction or component failure of the aircraft that would contribute to the cause of the accident. The aircraft's gross weight and centre of gravity were within allowable limits at the time of the occurrence. The aircraft stalled and recovery was not accomplished. The aircraft struck the ground in a steep nose-down attitude.
