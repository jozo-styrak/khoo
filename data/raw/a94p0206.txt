Analysis


Analysis of the ATC radar data indicates that the two aircraft would not have collided even if the SD360 had not altered course. The analysis also reveals that when the military pilot identified the civilian aircraft, it was 1.5 nm ahead and 500 feet below. The CT-133 pilot did not alter his course to increase the distance between the two aircraft before he turned, about 18 seconds later, to pass in front of the SD360, because he believed that there was no risk of collision. However, the SD360 crew were concerned about the spacing because they believed that the other pilot had not seen them.



Findings


In the area of the incident, there are VFR routes established by the DND and TC that cross each other. Prior to this incident, neither department was aware of the other's route. Neither pilot was aware of the other's VFR route. Civilian and military pilots use different criteria to establish spacing between themselves and other VFR aircraft. The CT-133 pilot crossed in front of the SD360 at a distance that caused the SD360 pilot to be concerned for the safety of his aircraft.
