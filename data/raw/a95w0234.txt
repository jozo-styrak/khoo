Analysis



Findings


Both flight crews were certified and qualified, and both aircraft were certified, equipped, and maintained in accordance with existing regulations and approved procedures. Staffing in the tower was in accordance with Transport Canada unit standards. All necessary tower equipment was serviceable and being used. Icy runway sides and exit conditions prevailed, and the lighting conditions were conducive to poor traffic detection. Considering the airport surface conditions, the spacing between the arriving and the preceding aircraft was insufficient. The Cheyenne crew did not explicitly (assertively and accurately) communicate that they were not clear of the active runway.
