the droplet size was in fact greater than the range of 40 to 50 microns	the conditions encountered have been outside the FAR 25 Appendix C certification envelope
Specifically , although the A321 has a double-slotted flap system rather than the single-slotted flap arrangement in the A320 , both aircraft were considered similar	of ice accretion on the leading edge of the flaps was not examined during A321 certification

Similarly , any A321 in-service icing anomalies were viewed in the context of the in-service performance of the entire A320 fleet	no systemic problem
Analysis of the post-occurrence icing trials concluded that ice accretion on the leading edge of the flaps of both the A320 and A321 , and on the flap tabs of the A321	unusual roll behaviour by modifying the aerodynamic characteristics
