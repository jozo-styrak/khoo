occurrence	this
the transfer of steering loads to the lower brackets	The fretting indicates that the attachments to the aircraft were moving
steering limits are exceeded	Failures of the attachment brackets on other aircraft have shown that towing the aircraft with the scissors connected damage the brackets
inputs to the steering tiller would be ineffective in maintaining directional control of the aircraft	move
the placard called for in SB 1125-11-181 been attached to the landing gear doors	the initial failure might have been avoided
The shimmy dampening characteristics of the steering system dampen or restrict movement of the nose gear system ; a sharp turn while towing with scissors connected , or turning the aircraft while towing the aircraft on an uneven surface	damaging forces the brackets
This	the fracture of the upper bracket
It is most likely that the occurrence aircraft was towed beyond the steering limits with the scissors connected	the fracture of the upper bracket
A nosewheel shimmy on landing stressed the remaining lower attachment bracket to overload and failure	the steering assembly and nose gear rotate uncontrollably
Although SBs were issued	the initial failure
