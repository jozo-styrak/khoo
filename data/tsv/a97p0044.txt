failures in the drive train from the engine to the final output shaft	Both engines suffered uncontained failures of the power turbine blades
both engines are considered secondary	The failures of the input shafts
the excessive loads placed on it when the worn clutch began to slip and then suddenly re-engaged	This shaft sheared
a loss of lubrication	The number 2 engine continued to run while the helicopter was on its side , and the engine eventually failed
drive system vibrations	The bearing races probably began to wear while the clutch was engaged , and the ball bearings wore grooves into the races
the excessive loads placed on it when the worn clutch slipped and then suddenly re-engaged	The number 1 engine clutch coupling shaft sheared
a lack of lubrication	The number 2 engine continued to run while the helicopter was on its side , and the engine eventually failed
the excessive loads	it
the resulting imbalance	extreme loads
No single factor was found	the clutch to wear
The grooves	greater stress on the outer race during clutch freewheeling -LRB- when there would have been relative motion between the inner and outer races of the bearings -RRB-
contamination from the wear metals of the bearings	wear on the clutch engagement surfaces
the wear in the clutch	the C-box chip light warning experienced eight days before the accident
the symptoms	them suspect a clutch malfunction
The operational environment in which the helicopter worked was not unusual , and no operational practice was identified	abnormal clutch wear
the excessive loads	it
