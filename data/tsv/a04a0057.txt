Based on this report , the crew planned for and executed a straight-in , localizer back-course approach to Runway 11 , anticipating no difficulties	, they did not plan for a diversion , and the approach choice was based upon the most expedient approach for the reported weather conditions
the destination weather is reported to be at or near minimums	crews update weather information , choose the approach most likely to be successful , and make plans for a possible diversion prior to the approach at destination
the destination weather is reported to be well above minimums	crews anticipate a successful approach and landing and may forgo alternate planning and choose the most expedient approach likely to be successful
and executed a straight-in , localizer back-course approach to Runway 11 , anticipating no difficulties	Based on this report , the crew planned

The crew were	the runway environment at the MDA of 270 feet agl
better guidance as to when additional check observations are required , including specific reference to the consideration of forecasts , temperature/dew point spread , etc	the completion of additional check observations
the approach most likely to be successful	plans for a possible diversion prior to the approach at destination
This option	the chances of landing successfully on the first approach
there was enough fuel on board	a second approach
During the rejected landing the aircraft 's wings were not leveled until after the nose was raised	the left wing contacting the runway
The aircraft 's wings were not leveled until after the nose was raised	the left wing contacting the runway
the crew and the unnecessarily low fuel state	the planning errors
This	the planning errors made by the crew and the unnecessarily low fuel state
