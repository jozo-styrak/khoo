accident likely involves a combination of several factors	Although a reduction in available take-off power as a result of carburettor icing or other system malfunction can not be ruled out , the investigation of the evidence available did not reveal any such pre-impact condition
carburettor icing or other system malfunction can not be ruled out , the investigation of the evidence available did not reveal any such pre-impact condition	Although a reduction in available take-off power
the characteristics of the laminar flow air foil	the aircraft nose must be lowered substantially before drag is reduced to allow the aircraft to accelerate
the almost complete destruction of the aircraft by the crash and fire	it could not be determined whether any pre-impact failure or system malfunction contributed to the accident
the engine was	substantial power at impact
an expectation of greater aircraft performance	the aircraft 's past performance
The pilot used a soft-field take-off technique which , in combination with the terrain rise at about the 1,000-foot mark of the airstrip	the aircraft to become airborne prematurely at a low airspeed with a nose-high attitude
small increases in angle of attack	significant increases in drag
drag is reduced	the aircraft to accelerate
drag is	to allow the aircraft to accelerate
any pre-impact failure or system malfunction	the accident
approximately 300 rpm	speed setting was
On take-off , the aircraft became airborne prematurely and maintained a nose-high attitude	the aircraft accelerating and climbing sufficiently to clear the obstacles
