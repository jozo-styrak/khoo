the pilot encountered deteriorating weather and reversed course to return to Bancroft	he decided to climb to a safe altitude even though this action would place him in solid IMC conditions
Once forced to terminate the VFR sightseeing flight , an early decision to climb on top of the cloud	regain VMC would have decreased the pilot 's workload and simplified his decision making considerably

he realized that the weather in the surrounding area was poor	he decided that he had to make a landing attempt at Bancroft Aerodrome by conducting an IMC cloud-breaking procedure
he broke out of the clouds	the low ceiling and limited visibility prevented him from conducting a successful visual approach

Toronto Radio	the pilot with detailed weather information regarding the fog and low ceilings throughout the entire area and with the assistance required to obtain an IFR clearance

The pilot was not prepared for in-flight weather conditions	him fly in IMC and change from a VFR flight plan to an IFR flight plan
The pilot 's lack of familiarity in an IFR environment , coupled with his expectation that the low cloud at Bancroft would dissipate as quickly as it had formed	his decision to hold in the vicinity of Bancroft
