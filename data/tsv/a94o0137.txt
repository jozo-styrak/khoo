In addition , neither crew were able to anticipate the impending traffic conflict since they shared a common radio frequency with the ACC controller for only about 45 seconds prior to the TCAS warnings	, when OEL 1967 was cleared to the Timmins airport for a straight-in ILS approach to runway 03 and commenced a descent from 5,000 asl while inbound and in close proximity to the 210-degree VOR radial , a significant risk of collision existed with OEL 1968 which was outbound on the 210-degree VOR radial and cleared from 4,000 to 17,000 feet asl
The ACC controller based his traffic separation plan on the mistaken premise that OEL 1967 was going to proceed northeast of the airport on the 12 DME arc approach for runway 21	would not conflict with OEL 1968 departing the area to the southwest
there was no radar coverage	he did not have any visual radar target cues on his indicator module -LRB- IM -RRB- to assist him in recognizing the risk of collision scenario developing
