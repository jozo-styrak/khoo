When the FD command bars were hidden from view , the PF did not realize this was an indication of an autopilot mode failure , nor did he realize that the amber ALT CAP light also denoted an autopilot mode failure	he did not disconnect the autopilot
The captain was immersed in his PNF duties and did not adequately monitor the aircraft and the PF	, he was not aware of the aircraft 's attitude and airspeed until the stick shaker activated
The altitude capture profile was too aggressive for the energy available at the time , and the autopilot pitched the aircraft up in an attempt to fly the commanded altitude profile	, there was a decrease in airspeed
the aircraft began the take-off run	all systems were operating normally
During the initial climb , the PF allowed the airspeed to increase above the desired climb speed	the aircraft had ample energy to meet the ALT CAP parameters early in the initial climb phase
the PF increased the pitch attitude to 22	the airspeed began to decrease
climb thrust was selected	the airspeed decreased more quickly , which resulted in insufficient energy to maintain the ALT CAP capture profile
the FD command bars were hidden from view	the PF did not realize this was an indication of an autopilot mode failure , nor did he realize that the amber ALT CAP light also denoted an autopilot mode failure
auto systems are activated or engaged	the crew 's responsibility to continue the monitoring of aircraft systems and instruments is not diminished
the PF	the airspeed to increase above the desired climb speed
the PF	the pitch attitude 22
When climb thrust was selected , the airspeed decreased more quickly	insufficient energy
The pilot flying -LRB- PF -RRB- did not operate the aircraft as required during the initial climb after take-off	the aircraft speed reduce until stick shaker activation
