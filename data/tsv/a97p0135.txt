Based on that information , he judged that GLR738 could depart with about minimum spacing from the preceding aircraft	, he released GLR738 with an initial spacing of about 3 nm , just above the separation standard of 3 NM
and further reduced the spacing between the two aircraft	converge
the crew of ABL819 reached 3,000 feet	they initiated a right turn to 335 in accordance with their clearance
he became aware that a loss of separation was occurring	he attempted to apply speed control to stabilize the situation
, in his judgement , the separation would be re-established more quickly by allowing the aircraft to continue the climb rather than by levelling or descending it	The controller did not attempt to level the Beechcraft 1900D at 2,000 feet
These prior situations had not been formally reported so the repeat nature and impact of the problem was not captured by the Nav Canada reporting system	, not all controllers were aware of the situation
the tower	the initial spacing
When the crew of ABL819 reached 3,000 feet , they initiated a right turn to 335 in accordance with their clearance ; that northbound turn , coupled with the aircraft 's south offset from the runway centre-line	the flight paths of ABL819 and GLR738
that northbound turn , coupled with the aircraft 's south offset from the runway centre-line , caused the flight paths of ABL819 and GLR738 to converge	the spacing between the two aircraft
in both the ACC and the tower	controllers were aware of the performance characteristics of the Beechcraft 1900D
The tower controller is required to judge the initial spacing between successive IFR departures ; other than operational experience , the controller has limited data on	this judgement
GLR738 was	no climb-rate restrictions
the pilot	the aircraft to accelerate to about 190 knots after take-off
this higher speed	the aircraft to close rapidly on the preceding DHC-8
the Nav Canada reporting systems were	this data
