occurrence	this
the throttle was rolled full open at take-off there could be a slight rotor rpm drop during climb out ; however	the fuel control/governor sense the drop , increase the fuel schedule and restore the rpm
an abrupt input to the anti-torque pedals was applied	Information gathered from past occurrences has indicated that the helicopter roll towards inverted
the helicopter was configured on fixed floats	The roll rate be greatest at high airspeeds , and
inappropriate anti-torque pedal input	Abrupt helicopter attitude changes
If the throttle was rolled full open at take-off there could be a slight rotor rpm drop during climb out ; however , the fuel control/governor would sense the drop	the fuel schedule
No mechanical deficiencies were identified	the rotor rpm decay in flight
the pilot	collective pitch in an attempt to reduce the descent rate just prior to impact with the ground
attempt	the descent rate
It is possible that the equipment or cord could have fallen on , or become entangled in , the exposed flight control stub shafts or the anti-torque pedals	pilot input those controls
A distraction-causing event , such as the strobing equipment or the note pad falling off the AME 's lap during the flight , and a subsequent attempt to grab the falling item	a leg being unintentionally extended and striking one of the anti-torque pedals with sufficient force to initiate a severe yaw
A loss of control at low altitude	little time the pilot to arrest the descent before striking the ground
