friction	This caused increased heat
inadequate lubrication to the linkpin bushings	This indicates that the engine failed catastrophically
lowering	the nose and landing straight ahead
This resulted in a rapid descent	with the bog
the pilot followed the guidance of the Beaver flight manual and proceeded straight ahead while maintaining a safe flying speed	the crash landing could possibly have been less violent
a pilot thought the oil pressure was too low while operating the engine out of the green arc	This inconsistency with industry practice lead to confusion and inadvertent landings
the pilot worn the shoulder harness	it is likely that his injuries would have been less severe
the absence of the linkpin plugs	a reduced oil pressure at the master rod bearing and crankpin interface
This caused increased heat due to friction , accelerated wear , and smearing of the bearing material	the lack of lubrication to critical engine components
This caused	heat
This	heat
this decision was	finding a more suitable landing area than the terrain located straight ahead of the aircraft
the aircraft 's airspeed	and
This	a rapid descent and considerable impact with the bog
This inconsistency with industry practice	confusion and inadvertent landings if a pilot thought the oil pressure was too low while operating the engine out of the green arc
The linkpin plugs had not been installed in the recently overhauled engine	inadequate lubrication the linkpin bushings , increased heat , and eventually an abrupt engine failure
the linkpin bushings	heat
The failure to utilize available shoulder harnesses	the risk and severity of injury
