The pilot most likely allowed the airspeed to decrease to the point that the aircraft stalled on approach at an altitude at which recovery was unlikely	was non-survivable because of the high impact forces
the drag at the full flap setting , there would be a more rapid reduction in airspeed than on a normal approach , unless significant engine power was added	However ,
the stall developed fully	the wing dropped violently at an altitude that was insufficient for the pilot to recover the aircraft
the broken airframe antenna	The ELT likely generated a signal ; however , the signal would not have been transmitted
the high impact forces	The impact was non-survivable
The most likely scenario	the damage the aircraft and the bank and impact angles
Any distraction could result in the pilot relaxing the pressure on the control yoke	a shallowing of the approach angle
Any distraction	the pilot relaxing the pressure on the control yoke
The heavy weight of the aircraft	the stall speed
These factors	the pilot not recognizing the impending aerodynamic stall
The remaining antenna cable	a weak signal would be attenuated further when the aircraft overturned and submerged
The pilot most likely	the airspeed to decrease to the point that the aircraft stalled on approach at an altitude at which recovery was unlikely
regulation for flight with an unserviceable ELT	the 30-day period
The pilot did not secure the cargo prior to flight	the cargo to shift forward on impact
