If the adhesive had cured -LRB- solidified -RRB- , it is unlikely that it could have penetrated the cracks	, it is reasonable to believe that the cracks were present when the adhesive was in liquid state , such as during the installation of the bushing at the time of overhaul , and that it penetrated into the pre-existing cracks in the bore arm
workload , working conditions , tools , operator ability , lack of supervision , misreading or misinterpretation of instructions	The crack should have been identified during overhaul but , for unknown reasons , it was not
the bore surface was worn and damaged	This could not be proven
the condition of the tooling	It may have been induced during the machining process of the inner bore surface at manufacture , or possibly
moisture	entry into this area during the service life of the nose landing gear
the adhesive had cured -LRB- solidified -RRB-	it is unlikely that it have penetrated the cracks
the main larger crack	the eventual failure of the nose landing gear
There were also imperfections on the inner surface of the housing	the initiation of the crack
the fracture of the oleo strut housing trunnion link arm , which was initiated by an existing fatigue crack in the bore of the link arm	failure
The crack propagated during the pre-overhaul service life of the nose gear and progressed further during the post-overhaul service of the aircraft	an overload fracture
