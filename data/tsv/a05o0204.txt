it was considered highly unlikely that the pilots would intentionally spin the glider at such a low altitude	the spin was almost certainly entered into inadvertently
the glider was still in a spin at ground impact and the investigation revealed no flight control discrepancies before impact	it is likely that the pilots did not execute the proper spin-recovery technique
Before entering the circuit in preparation for landing , the pilots may have encountered a thermal and attempted to gain altitude	the speed to decrease to the point of stall and spin
no indication that incapacitation or physiological factors	the performance of either pilot
the investigation	no flight control discrepancies before impact
a loose article in the cockpit became jammed in the controls	the pilots applying proper spin-recovery controls can not be ruled out
However , it is considered more likely that the very steep , nose-down attitude of the glider while in the spin , coupled with the ground proximity	the pilot flying retaining pro spin elevator controls
