insufficient winch speed , which could lead to aerodynamic stall	It is unlikely therefore , that the loss of control was
the bolt tearing out , which would suggest that the bolt in the right anchor nut was only engaged by a maximum of four threads	The shiny appearance of the threads on the right anchor nut was likely
the bolts pulled out in the air	impact , other information supports the conclusion
the cross-threading damage , the probability	the centre and right bolts were not fully engaged , and the acceleration forces of the launch resulted in the bolts pulling free from the anchor nuts resulting in seat failure
the seat failed	the pilot would have moved downward and aft , away from the controls
estimating the wind direction and speed does not provide sufficiently accurate information , and is not adequate when operating in light and variable wind conditions	The practice of utilizing a signal flag or a piece of plastic tape
the cross-threading damage , the probability	the centre and right bolts were not fully engaged , and the acceleration forces of the launch resulted in the bolts pulling free from the anchor nuts , resulting in seat failure
the winch operator provided a full-out launch	the wind conditions
the winch operator	a full-out launch
It is unlikely therefore , that the loss of control was due to insufficient winch speed	aerodynamic stall
During the accident launch , acceleration forces would have effectively pressed the pilot rearward	high load forces the seat and its attachment hardware
this amount of thread engagement	the maximum strength of the bolt
the assembly	the full clamping force
the combined effect of the cross-threading damage , the probability that the centre and right bolts were not fully engaged , and the acceleration forces of the launch	the bolts pulling free from the anchor nuts resulting in seat failure
the anchor nuts	seat failure
This sudden rearward movement	a corresponding rearward control stick movement , and an abrupt pitch
the pilot	the manual tow cable release
A windsock	pilots with more accurate wind information , during takeoff , and while on approach landing
The combined effect of the cross-threading damage , the probability that the centre and right bolts were not fully engaged , and the acceleration forces of the launch resulted in the bolts pulling free from the anchor nuts	seat failure
The combined effect of the cross-threading damage , the probability that the centre and right bolts were not fully engaged , and the acceleration forces of the launch	the bolts pulling free from the anchor nuts
