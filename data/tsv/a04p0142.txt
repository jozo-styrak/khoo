The TOT harness may have had a 0.03 ohms discrepancy , and the incorrect TOT gauge was replaced due to a 15 C indication error ; it was installed for only 63.1 hours during which , in the worst case scenario , it may have provided inaccurate engine temperature indicatons	their contribution was unlikely because turbine blades that have been subjected to long-term overheating will normally show a change in the distribution of the gamma prime phase , due to partial re-solutioning
vibration -LRB- blade flutter -RRB-	Possible fatigue initiation scenarios for the second-stage turbine wheel blade include tip rubbing , the presence of physical or metallurgical defects , high-cycle fatigue cracking
but is retrained by the cooler hub material	expand
thermal	fatigue
The engine oil pressure and temperature gauge that had been installed for some time was for a C20B model	, it had incorrect markings
erroneous readings	Also , the TOT harness and TOT gauge were replaced about 312 airframe hours before the occurrence ,
a 15 C indication	The TOT harness may have had a 0.03 ohms discrepancy , and the incorrect TOT gauge was replaced
partial re-solutioning	The effects of these erroneous TOT indications and any contribution to the turbine wheel cracking could not be determined within the scope of this investigation ; however , it was suggested that their contribution was unlikely because turbine blades that have been subjected to long-term overheating will normally show a change in the distribution of the gamma prime phase ,

detected	Hot starting events are not recorded by this helicopter 's instrumentation and not be recorded accurately by an operator , even
hot starting	About 45 engine hours before the occurrence , the engine fuel control unit was adjusted
overstress rupture when the remaining area could no longer support the applied loads	Thermally induced fatigue cracking initiated radially inward in a low-cycle mode in the blade platform fillet area , then progressed normal to the blade axis in a high-cycle mode , eventually resulting in a blade failure
detected	Hot starting events and/or power transients are not recorded in this type of helicopter and not be recorded accurately by an operator even
their effects go unchecked	Turbine wheel failures occur when hot starts and power transients are undetected , or
dis-bonding due to a bond failure that likely resulted in a slight loss of engine efficiency	Approximately 25 per cent of the major diameter seal was missing from the rear support
a bond failure that likely resulted in a slight loss of engine efficiency	Approximately 25 per cent of the major diameter seal was missing from the rear support as a result of dis-bonding
Metallurgical analysis did not reveal any manufacturing or material anomalies	fatigue initiation
This compressive stress	a localized yielding of the turbine wheel rim material
operational temperatures	tensile
it	inaccurate engine temperature indicatons

cracks in the fillet radius of blades	turbine failures
The first-stage turbine wheel	many type A and approximately four type B cracks in the blade rim
Approximately 25 per cent of the major diameter seal was missing from the rear support as a result of dis-bonding due to a bond failure	a slight loss of engine efficiency
