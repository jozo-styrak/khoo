performing these manoeuvres , they had not been documented	Although the aircraft had been put through simple aerobatic manoeuvres before , and it could have met the criteria
decreasing	limit
replacing the bolts	the ultimate load was therefore between 4.4 g and 5.2 g at full load -LRB- 2400 pounds -RRB- or between 4.9 g and 5.8 g at the time of the accident , since the weight of the aircraft was estimated at 2125 pounds
the 1.5 safety factor is taken into account	the maximum load is reduced to between 2.9 g and 4.3 g , which is below the 4.4 g level prescribed in CAR Section 523.337 for aerobatics
the flight is not in a perfectly straight line	However , the aerodynamic stresses on different areas of the aircraft be different
which would have resulted in separation of the left wing as well	fail
the major deformation observed on the bolt from the lower left spar	the bolt was about to fail , which would have resulted in separation of the left wing as well
all modifications were done prior to the last inspection and prior to the issuance of the special airworthiness certificate	there were no other regulatory requirements in this regard
the resulting strength was greater than the maximum loads that could be applied in flight	Reducing the strength of the front fitting had no adverse impact
between 61 and 72 per cent by replacing the bolts	and that this value
These loads	a blackout , as well as the beginning of brain hypoxia
A loss of situational awareness could have caused the pilot flying to continue applying elevator to the point where the maximum strength of the wings was exceeded , while the aircraft was still at an altitude	the pilot to follow a less pronounced recovery curve , which would have generated lesser loads
A loss of situational awareness	the pilot flying to continue applying elevator to the point where the maximum strength of the wings was exceeded , while the aircraft was still at an altitude that would have allowed the pilot to follow a less pronounced recovery curve , which would have generated lesser loads
Given the major deformation observed on the bolt from the lower left spar , the bolt was about to fail	separation of the left wing
the attachment bolts of the main spars	the capacity of the wings to react to loads as great as those estimated by the builder-pilot
excessive tension	failure
