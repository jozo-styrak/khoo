The engines were installed and operated on the same aircraft , exposed to the same environment under the same operating conditions , and maintained with the same procedures	, it is expected that internal engine condition and wear patterns would be similar
two engines on the same aircraft fail for the same mechanical reasons in such a short time	this reliability is brought into question
stress corrosion cracking of the second-stage turbine blades , a failure mode	Pratt and Whitney has been actively trying to control through the use of sacrificial corrosion protection coatings
two engine failures	these
the reaction of the coated PWA1484 alloy of the second-stage turbine blades to the anhydrite that had formed on its surface	The corrosion was
The flight management , guidance , and envelope computer -LRB- FMGEC -RRB- software did not recognize that the engine had been shut down	did not authorize auto thrust for the remaining engine
The difference between the two engines was the more pronounced leaking of the rear side plate seal of engine P733335	greater airflow thus more dirt contamination into the under-platform cavity
greater airflow thus more dirt contamination into the under-platform cavity	the rate of corrosion attack
The subsequent air leaks	an increased rate of corrosion attack in both engines
the coatings	protection
