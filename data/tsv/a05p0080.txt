there are no fire-suppression systems in the engine compartments	it is important that the crew members accomplish the critical action checklist immediately , to restrict flammable fluids from entering the engine area and to land as soon as possible
the time and workload associated with configuring the aircraft for an immediate landing	These actions may have been omitted
some point after 01 April 1999	a bad gasket -LRB- P/N LW-13388 -RRB- was installed in the accident engine
Based on the fire pattern in the accessory section of the right engine and on the inspection and testing of involved components , it was apparent that an oil filter converter plate gasket had failed	pressurized engine oil spray into the engine compartment
on secondary indicators of fire	the crew both in identifying a fire and reacting to it
Because there are no fire-suppression systems in the engine compartments , it is important that the crew members accomplish the critical action checklist immediately	flammable fluids entering the engine area and to land as soon as possible
The flames then breached the main fuel tank , inboard of the engine	the aircraft to become engulfed in flames
The improper oil filter converter plate gasket in the right engine compartment failed	pressurized oil spray into the engine compartment and ignite on contact with hot turbo-charger and exhaust components
The firewall fuel shut-off valve remained in the OPEN position	pressurized fuel be delivered to the engine-driven fuel pump by the aircraft 's boost pumps
The initial oil-fed fire generated considerable heat , which melted the casing of the engine-driven fuel pump	pressurized fuel intensify the fire
The flames breached the main fuel tank , inboard of the engine	the aircraft to become engulfed in flames
