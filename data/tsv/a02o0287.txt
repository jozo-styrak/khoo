a successful turn back	making
turning back was a feasible option	If such a hard rule had been formulated prior to the simulated engine failure , the student not have to analyse the factors after the simulated engine failure to determine
At this point the aircraft was both low enough and slow enough that a successful forced landing was not assured	the instructor to take control of the aircraft
the lack of pre-flight planning for this exercise	the instructor was not prepared for the dangerous situation which had quickly developed and , as a consequence , tried to salvage the forced landing rather than apply power to execute an effective abort procedure
head trauma during the occurrence	The instructor suffered loss of memory
the student pilot was	the 180-degree turn which put the aircraft in a downwind approach to the lake
Therefore , the student was not fully aware of the expected actions following a simulated engine failure at low altitude	the risk errors could be made
