Errors by trainees are likely	, a trainee is generally under the guidance of an experienced tutor and does not operate under his or her own licence
The OJI did not monitor the traffic in sufficient detail to be aware of the flight level of the Piaggio P-180	, the Airbus was cleared to that same flight level
the intervention is often done through the trainee who committed the original error	However , the OJI can not quickly intervene with flight crews to correct errors
, from his position at the time , a right turn would have been necessary to accomplish that	A right turn would fit his expectation to overfly Massena en route to John F. Kennedy International Airport ,
the	vector
resolving losses of separation in time-critical situations should be an important element of a controller 's training	Techniques
The controllers recognized the first developing loss-of-separation situation and issued instructions that , if followed	it
the misinterpreted message	the loss of separation
Under normal circumstances , miscommunication regarding the direction of a turn , together with permissive OJI monitoring	an adverse result
unforeseen interruptions or pilot misunderstandings and the delays that are inherent in second-hand controlling	losses of separation
the vectoring technique of direction of turn and the number of degrees to turn	one
the direction of turn and the final heading	two
The use of this confusing terminology and the subsequent pilot efforts to confirm the meaning of the transmission	the resolution of the first loss of separation
timely avoidance instructions	the required separation between the Regional Jet and the Airbus
instructions to the Airbus crew	a loss of separation
The OJI permitted the trainee Valley controller	issuing resolution instructions to conflicting traffic
A pilot 's error in interpreting the avoidance action	the loss of separation
the flight crew	an error
This error	the rate of closure between the Airbus and the Regional Jet
