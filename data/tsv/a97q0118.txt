In low-altitude flight , his field of view had to be very limited , and , because navigation charts are planform views whereas nothing is seen in planform at this height , the pilot would have difficulty in following the progress of the flight on the VFR navigation chart on which the elevation of the terrain appeared	, although the pilot knew where Lac S bastien was located in relation to his aircraft , he did not know his exact position and was flying at an altitude lower than some of the surrounding terrain
The aircraft 's attitude on impact suggests that the pilot was controlling the aircraft just prior to the accident	conceivable that the pilot probably did not have the necessary visual references and did not see the ground in time to avoid it
examination of the aircraft did not reveal any irregularity and no distress call was received from the pilot	The possibility of a failure of the aircraft 's engine or systems was discarded
The chosen route was over mountainous terrain , with some mountain peaks concealed by the clouds	, the pilot was unable to recognize the dangers that he was likely to encounter
veering	southeast in order to fly in visual meteorological conditions -LRB- VMC -RRB-
The pilot decided not to land , but to deviate from the direct route and try to reach his destination by veering southeast	fly in visual meteorological conditions -LRB- VMC -RRB- ; he may have even tried to follow the power transmission line
the weather conditions required him to focus the greatest part of his attention on manoeuvring the aircraft to maintain VMC	It is likely that the pilot was not aware of his true position in relation to the terrain and topography of the area and was relying on the GPS to get to his destination
navigation charts are planform views whereas nothing is seen in planform at this height , the pilot would have difficulty in following the progress of the flight on the VFR navigation chart on which the elevation of the terrain appeared	In low-altitude flight , his field of view had to be very limited , and ,
adverse weather conditions , it is also possible that the desire of the pilot and the passengers to return home influenced the pilot 's decision to undertake the flight	As the return journey had already been delayed by one day
but continued pressing toward his destination	land
the pilot was	the dangers
Faced with deteriorating weather conditions	continuation of the flight hazardous
the pilot had	a decision
one day because of adverse weather conditions	the return journey
the desire of the pilot and the passengers to return home	the pilot 's decision to undertake the flight
no evidence that incapacitation or physiological factors	the pilot 's performance
