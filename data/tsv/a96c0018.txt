When the Navajo arrived in the vicinity of Dryden , the pilot did not reset the altimeter from 30.38 to the appropriate setting of 30.08	, although the pilot of the Navajo flew at a VFR cruising altitude of 7,500 feet with reference to the altimeter , the aircraft was actually flying at about 7,200 feet asl
Because the controller was performing the duties of both radar and data controller , he prioritized his tasks , giving higher priority to the data controller tasks and lower priority to the provision of traffic information	, he spent little time monitoring the uncorrelated digital target symbols
This prioritization is permitted by the ATC procedures specified in MANOPS	, he did not provide traffic information to the Chieftain

the incorrect altimeter setting	the Navajo was flying about 300 feet lower than the indicated altitude
the aircraft passed	the vertical distance between them was about 300 feet less than the required vertical distance of 500 feet
Because the controller was performing the duties of both radar and data controller , he prioritized his tasks	higher priority to the data controller tasks and lower priority the provision of traffic information
The lack of guidance on the use of the recommended en route frequency of 126.7 MHz	the possibility of immediate communication between the pilots
