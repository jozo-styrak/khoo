the unserviceable	instruments found during testing , the final portion of the ILS approach , crew decision making during the visual landing , the lack of crew coordination during the approach , passenger evacuation , and ERS response
the captain 's instrument was performing adequately in flight	The glide slope indicator 's lack of responsiveness found during testing was probably overcome in the air by aircraft vibration ,
the aircraft 's speed remained above VRef until touchdown , a five-knot error in his calls would have been of no consequence	The error in the first officer 's airspeed indicator would have caused him to call out airspeed deviations with a five-knot error ; however ,
the runway environment became visible to the crew	the aircraft rate of descent
both crew members diverted their attention outside the cockpit to concentrate on visual references to the runway	This latter deviation from the glide slope probably occurred
an estimated landing distance of 4700 feet was required and a landing distance of 6000 feet was available	A landing at Dryden was possible for the accident aircraft under the ambient conditions
both of these parameters were exceeded	the likelihood of a successful landing was reduced
a	state of expectancy or predisposition -LRB- mind-set -RRB- which can distort what is perceived
The error in the first officer 's airspeed indicator	him to call out airspeed deviations with a five-knot error
An excessive power setting by the PF	the aircraft to become high on the glide slope as the range to the runway decreased from 2.5 to 1 nm
the aircraft rate of descent	and
During the approach , there was no discussion between the crew members and there was a lack of calls by the first officer regarding glide slope and airspeed deviations	the poorly-flown approach
this distance is	a threshold crossing height of 50 feet and a threshold crossing speed of 109 knots
one	a series of sequential , related decisions
Two of the passengers who saw a fire in the tail pipe of the left engine	the crew 's attention
fuel leaking on the hot brakes	possibility of a fire
Crew coordination during the approach and landing was minimal and ineffective	the poorly-flown approach
this did	the accident
