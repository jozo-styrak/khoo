obscures the natural horizon and , in this occurrence , the difficulty in seeing the horizon would be exacerbated by the low cloud	The most likely scenario to account for this accident involves a known phenomenon encountered by pilots flying in mountainous terrain
He would also probably have encountered a lowering ceiling , likely forcing him to descend below his cruising altitude of 5000 feet asl	maintain VFR flight
the high terrain	To contact ATC , he would have had to climb several thousand feet
the low performance of the aircraft at its high weight and high elevation , and the close proximity of numerous mountain peaks	A climb through cloud from his location would have been risky
the pilot abandoned visual flight , made a transition to instrument flight , and attempted to climb to a safe altitude	he would likely have encountered icing and possibly thunderstorms
he encountered rising terrain and lowering cloud	the pilot probably lowered the aircraft 's nose to avoid entering cloud and started a turn to reverse his course
no horizon would be visible when looking outside the aircraft	the only way to maintain control during this turn would be by reference to flight instruments
the relative proximity of the terrain , the aircraft struck a tree before the pilot was able to recover control	For unknown reasons , the pilot lost control of the aircraft , and
From Hope to the accident site , at the aircraft 's average radar observed ground speed , would take about seven minutes	the time of the accident approximately 1437
He would also probably have encountered a lowering ceiling	him descend below his cruising altitude of 5000 feet asl in order to maintain VFR flight
Had the pilot abandoned visual flight	a transition instrument flight
the low cloud	the difficulty in seeing the horizon
The high ground	the natural horizon
a tree before the pilot	control
