The review pointed out that cannabinoids are highly lipophilic , meaning that they are readily stored in fat	, it is possible for an individual to test positive for cannnabinoids for up to three months after drug use
the control head is on the first officer 's side of the cockpit	it was likely he who turned the NDB off
the short duration of the overshoot and the tasks that the first officer was performing	it is probable that he had a false perception that the aircraft was climbing
weather or environmental conditions where visual flight conditions do not prevail , as was the case when the overshoot was initiated	enter
this transition been made	the fact that the aircraft was not climbing would have been evident
the required climb angle was not set and maintained to ensure a positive rate of climb	The aircraft was flown into terrain during an overshoot
no indication that they	his performance before or during the accident
cannabinoid use	human performance
The absence of drug testing for commercial pilots	the chance of detecting the presence of cannabis
The descent into Shamattawa , Manitoba , was started late	the aircraft being high and fast on approach
The use of the lower altimeter setting	the aircraft being high on the approach
The absence of ground-based VASIS	the determination of the approach angle more difficult for the crew
The presence of an VASIS	the crew to take earlier , more positive corrective action to avoid the missed approach
Neither pilot	any awareness or concern the aircraft was not in a climbing attitude
his being	the imposed acceleration as the aircraft speed increased from that of gravity
