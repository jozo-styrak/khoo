the aircraft was over the maximum certified take-off weight	the performance degradation would have resulted in a longer than normal take-off roll , a reduced climb rate , and an increased stall speed
he was distracted by the open baggage door	It is likely that the pilot had not selected the landing gear up after take-off
the baggage door opened	it was an unexpected and distracting event
the low altitude , the pilot was unable to recover in time to prevent the crash	It is concluded that the pilot allowed the airspeed to decrease to the point where the aircraft stalled , and
