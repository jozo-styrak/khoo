The radio controller did not have access to a plotting board as there was none at the sector at the time , and he could not off-centre his radar display because he was controlling traffic in the southern part of the combined sector	, there was a delay in passing the revised clearance to the aircraft
In this case , incorrectly plotting the aircraft 's position by the data controller was an error of inattention	of the time pressures felt by the data controller , in that the aircraft was nearing Brevoort controlled airspace , the controller did not adequately check the coordinates he had entered before executing the command to display the RBL
The Nuvilik data controller entered the wrong coordinates when generating an RBL on a vacant radar display , and he did not detect the error	, he advised the North specialty supervisor that N8MC was north of track rather than south of track , the aircraft 's actual position
Secondly , the Nuvilik radio controller did not have a clear mental picture of where the coordinate 64N 070W was in relation to the flight	, he was reluctant to issue this restriction until separation with the inbound BFF200 was assured
he was controlling traffic in the southern part of the combined sector	The radio controller did not have access to a plotting board as there was none at the sector at the time , and he could not off-centre his radar display
The North specialty controller would have been aware that the coordinates for the altitude restriction for N8MC were close to Iqaluit , necessitating a quick relay to the aircraft	give the crew time to comply with this restriction
The Nuvilik data controller became concerned that the restriction was not being passed , so	assist the radio controller , he plotted the revised course for N8MC on a vacant radar display and used the RBL function to plot the original and amended tracks for N8MC
the time pressures felt by the data controller	in that the aircraft was nearing Brevoort controlled airspace , the controller did not adequately check the coordinates he had entered before executing the command to display the RBL
a change would	the current track of an aircraft
the restriction	the initial track of N8MC
The operation of the ATC system is dependant on complete and timely coordination between units	provide a safe and efficient environment for users of the system
the OJI is sometimes placed in a delicate position of allowing more and more freedom to the trainee as training progresses	provide maximum benefit to the trainee under increasingly more difficult and challenging traffic conditions
ensuring that the requisite minimum separation standards are applied	The trainee was working under the authority of the OJI 's ATC licence , and it is the OJI who retains the responsibility
the Nuvilik data controller placed the flight data strip for N8MC containing the altitude restriction on the data board beside the trainee	it was the OJI , standing behind the trainee , who noticed it
he knew that the conflict between N8MC and BFF200 had to be solved first	The OJI , however , was not concerned that the restriction was not immediately passed ,
The North specialty controller would have been aware that the coordinates for the altitude restriction for N8MC were close to Iqaluit , necessitating a quick relay to the aircraft in order	the crew time comply with this restriction
The fact that none of the Nuvilik sector controllers had a clear mental picture of the proximity of the restriction point to the point of departure	the issuing of the information to the aircraft
In the rush to complete the task , the coordinates for the original track were entered in error	an RBL to be displayed that showed a false original track in relation to the amended track
The data controller did not intentionally plan to enter the wrong coordinates into the RDPS computer	an unintentional action that did not go as planned
actions are	stored routines
Firstly , the North specialty was equipped with a NADS	a visual display of the track based on the coordinates entered by the controller
a visual display of the track	the coordinates entered by the controller
Strained communication between the North and East specialties	the ease with which control information should have been exchanged and was more apparent between certain individuals than others
on complete and timely coordination between units in order	a safe and efficient environment users of the system
it did	communications between the North and the East specialties during this particular work shift
order	maximum benefit the trainee under increasingly more difficult and challenging traffic conditions
the Nuvilik data controller	the flight data strip for N8MC
The OJI	the situation to deteriorate into the loss of separation by not providing firmer guidance to the trainee to alleviate the uncertainty with respect to the aircraft 's position
The Nuvilik radio controller was not able to assess routing changes for N8MC without changing the centre of the radar indicator module	the loss of the radar display for the southern part of the sector
The Nuvilik radio controller was	routing changes for N8MC without changing the centre of the radar indicator module , which would result in the loss of the radar display for the southern part of the sector
The Nuvilik trainee radio controller did not know the exact position of N8MC when the altitude restriction was cancelled	the loss of separation
in a timely manner	the loss of separation
The climate of dissonance that had been allowed to develop between some of the controllers in the East and North specialties	the lack of communication
The climate of dissonance	to develop between some of the controllers in the East and North specialties
