Other aircraft on the ramp remained frost-covered until late that morning	of contaminated wings were present in this occurrence , and the aircraft stalled well above the normal stall speed
0900 , about 15 minutes before take-off	frost was reported on the indicator
contaminated	wings were present in this occurrence
aircraft	overloading and wing and flight control surface contamination
the flaps were retracted , further reducing lift	the aircraft experienced an aerodynamic stall and loss of control from which the pilot was unable to recover before the aircraft contacted the ground
the wings were contaminated	the classic stall indicators of aircraft buffet and audible stall warning were likely absent , at least initially
take-off	the aircraft was about 510 pounds in excess of its maximum take-off weight , adversely affecting aircraft performance
contamination	Retracting the flaps reduced the amount of lift being produced by the wing , already performing poorly
drag	the ability of the wings to produce lift
Based on these indications , it is concluded that the aircraft was contaminated with frost during the take-off	drag
the ability of the wings	lift
The aircraft was also overloaded	aircraft performance
As well	weight
When the flaps were retracted	lift
The pilot took off with frost adhering to the aircraft 's lifting surfaces , which increased drag	the ability of the wings to produce lift
The pilot took off with frost adhering to the aircraft 's lifting surfaces	drag
the ability of the wings	lift
510 pounds in excess of its maximum take-off weight , adversely	aircraft performance
the wing	the amount of lift
the flaps	the amount of lift being produced by the wing
