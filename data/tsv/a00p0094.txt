aircraft 's loss of engine power	the
an aerodynamic	stall resulting from low airspeed
the shoulder harness was not worn	The severity of injury resulting from the crash was increased
Testing and examination of the carburettor and the magnetos revealed defects	a rough-running engine
Testing and examination of the carburettor and the magnetos	defects that may have led to a rough-running engine
the use of MOGAS	the likelihood of this occurring
Examination of the aircraft did not reveal any defect	a loss of aircraft control
Carburettor icing	engine loss of power , which led the pilot to attempt a forced landing
Carburettor icing almost certainly contributed to engine loss of power	the pilot to attempt a forced landing
The pilot did not wear the available shoulder harness	the risk of injury
As well , the accident aircraft 's carburettor and magnetos had defects	a rough-running engine
The faulty left magneto	the engine to run rough at lower rpm
