The elevator trim-tab pushrod attachment bolt was found to be tightened to a value higher than that prescribed by the manufacturer	, when the inner bushing became seized , the pushrod clevis was not free to rotate
fatigue cracking of the threaded section of the rod end	The elevator trim pushrod failed
the bushing had seized	the trim pushrod had rotated about the inner face of the clevis and outer faces of the inner bushing
Reaming of the bushings without the associated drawings	a risk of seizure if the dimensional and out-of-round limits are not strictly observed
Movement between the two ill-fitting bushings , aided by the higher-than-prescribed installation torque on the through bolt , likely produced the galling	eventual seizure
Movement between the two ill-fitting bushings , aided by the higher-than-prescribed installation torque on the through bolt ,	the galling , which resulted in eventual seizure
rotation	the bending loads on the pushrod
The steel-on-steel design of the elevator trim-tab bushings	the risk of seizure
The fatigue crack was initiated by the increased bending load generated from a progressively stiffening pushrod to trim-tab attachment	limited elevator control
Movement between the two ill-fitting inner and outer bushings , aided by the higher than prescribed installation torque on the through bolt , likely produced the galling	seizure
Movement between the two ill-fitting inner and outer bushings , aided by the higher than prescribed installation torque on the through bolt ,	the galling , which eventually resulted in seizure
The elevator trim-tab inner and outer bushings are both made from stainless steel	the risk of seizure
Distribution of such bushings	the machining or reaming of bushings
Reaming of the bushings without the associated drawings	the risk of seizure
