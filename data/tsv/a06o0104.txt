The hinge bracket failed due to low cycle fatigue , which originated at the site of the identified impact damage	damage created a stress riser , which developed into a fatigue crack over the operating life of the hinge bracket
The impact damage created a stress riser , which developed into a fatigue crack over the operating life of the hinge bracket	damage was located in an area that is protected once the bracket is installed
However , it is unlikely that the hinge bracket will fail unless the flaps are extended for take-off or landing	, in the event of another failure , the aircraft would most likely be over a populated area
low cycle fatigue , which originated at the site of the identified impact damage	The hinge bracket failed
Although it is possible that another failure of this nature could occur in the future , there were no adverse effects on the flying characteristics of the aircraft	, the risk of a catastrophic event is low
The impact damage	a stress riser , which developed into a fatigue crack over the operating life of the hinge bracket
It is likely that the hinge bracket was damaged before or during installation and	the relatively small size of the damage
Hinge bracket damage , which occurred either before or during installation	a stress riser for a low cycle fatigue crack to develop and progress over the life of the part
This	the flap tab separate from the aircraft and strike a parked vehicle
