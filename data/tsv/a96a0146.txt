there was no electrical short to ground , which would also explain the absence of an EICAS warning pertaining to the window heat system	The circuit breaker for the windshield heat did not trip
the extensive damage	the origin of the failure could not be isolated
the solder	the braid to completely detach from the block
The high temperatures associated with arcing -LRB- thousands of degrees Centigrade -RRB-	the cratering of the inner glass ply
sufficient thermal stresses	the glass windshield
nicking of the copper braid during construction of the window	the copper strands flex sufficiently to initiate separation and allow electrical arcing to occur
separation	electrical arcing
An electrical failure under the J5 terminal block mounted on the right front window	arcing
The arcing caused cratering and localized melting of the inner glass ply	the cracking of the inner ply and the combustion of the epoxy terminal block , creating smoke
The arcing caused cratering and localized melting of the inner glass ply , which eventually led to the cracking of the inner ply and the combustion of the epoxy terminal block	smoke
The arcing	cratering and localized melting of the inner glass ply , which eventually led to the cracking of the inner ply and the combustion of the epoxy terminal block
