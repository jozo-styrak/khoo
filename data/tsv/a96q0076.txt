The slight nose-up attitude and the heading of the aircraft , about 25 degrees greater than that of the route planned and that of the breakup trajectory , suggest that the pilot initiated a climb and an uncoordinated right turn just before colliding with the ground	, it is reasonable to believe that the pilot evidently did not have the required visual references and did not see the ground in time to avoid it
avoiding obstructions	The pilot continued flight in adverse weather in which he risked losing the visual references necessary
the examination of the aircraft revealed no deficiencies and no distress calls were received	The hypothesis of an engine failure or aircraft system malfunction , or both , was eliminated ,
an emergency situation had occurred in flight	all passengers likely have been found in their seats with their seat-belts fastened
the crater were incorrect , the pilot was unaware of the actual position of the aircraft , and evidently arrived at the crater one minute sooner than he expected	The pilot was evidently using the information provided by the GPS to go directly to the crater ; since the coordinates entered in the GPS
the pilot had attempted such a manoeuvre	it is highly probable that the aircraft have struck the ground in a nose-down attitude
using the GPS	to arrive over the crater in visual meteorological conditions -LRB- VMC -RRB-
the prevailing weather conditions	However , the pilot encountered reduced visibility and whiteout conditions , where there was a considerable risk that he would lose visual contact with the ground
incorrect coordinates were entered in the GPS	the crater 's actual position was 2.5 nm east of the position indicated by the GPS
the examination of the aircraft	no deficiencies and no distress calls were received
the GPS	the information
the pilot encountered	visibility and
physiological factors	no evidence that his performance
serious coronary arteriosclerosis	the pilot 's death , there was no evidence that his performance was affected by physiological factors
In fact , the aircraft attitude and heading on impact indicate that the pilot was not affected by any incapacitation	him controlling the aircraft
the GPS	the information
his knowledge of the area , the proximity of the crater , and the information provided by the GPS	the pilot 's decision
no evidence that incapacitation or physiological factors	the pilot 's performance
