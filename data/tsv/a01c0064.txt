one	vibrations in the cyclic control
The uneven bends in the tail-rotor pitch control links	dissimilar tail-rotor blade angles
Unequal blade angles , in flight	anti-torque pedal vibrations similar to those described by the pilot
The extensive damage to the main-rotor blades and the primary flight controls of the helicopter during the rollover precluded the determination of any subtle in-flight failure , loosening , or separation of a control component	the control vibrations
The fact that the pilot	the descent
