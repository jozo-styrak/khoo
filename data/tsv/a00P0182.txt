Since then , little wear was seen on the IFWU gear housing	likely that the operator 's standard operating practices , at the time of the incident , contributed to the accelerated wear seen in the incident IFWU
IFWUs in the S-61 helicopter are susceptible to high wear rates under certain operational conditions	, IFWUs can fail , cause engine overspeed , and shut down
A review of the flight crew 's actions during this incident revealed no indication that their actions contributed to or exacerbated the chain of events	the freewheel unit slippage
A review of the flight crew 's actions during this incident	no indication their actions contributed to or exacerbated the chain of events that led to the freewheel unit slippage
some standard operating procedures	the freewheel unit slippage
a combination of frequent overrunning of the same IFWU , frequent single-engine training , and rotor engagement techniques	wear in the IFWU
the free power turbine overshoot	the amount of IFWU freewheeling
The Sikorsky recommendations of alternating rotor engagements between engines , moderating engine acceleration when matching torques , monitoring the free power turbine overshoot , and reducing the amount of IFWU freewheeling have	the frequency of IFWU slippages
rotor engagements between engines	the amount of IFWU freewheeling
It is therefore likely that the operator 's standard operating practices , at the time of the incident	the accelerated wear seen in the incident IFWU
a combination of frequent overrunning of the same IFWU , frequent single-engine training , and rotor engagement techniques	wear in the IFWU
As a result , IFWUs can fail	engine overspeed
