The crew did not have the device changed or take any action to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning	possible that they did not include the detector in their cockpit scan and , thus , did not observe any change in the colour of the detection spot
the self-dispatch system	there was no back-up system to check loading decisions made by the crew
it been serviceable	the spot would have changed colour
the detector was time expired	the spot have also been a different colour than the surrounding circle
the device is passive and has no warning system	to attract the attention of the crew
Wreckage examination did not uncover any control system or engine problem	a loss of control during the go-around
Two scenarios	loss of control were considered
First , the C of G , at about 32.3 inches aft of the aft limit	a loss of control
the crew had been	the aircraft throughout the flight
The securing of the 2x4s , as shown in Appendix A	their movement
This would have moved the C of G further aft	the loss of control
The subsequent decisions about the positioning and securing of the 2x4s and the use of the previous weight and balance calculation	a dangerous situation
the brief stopover between flights	the level of carbon monoxide saturation
the crew	loading decisions
the incorrect index number	making
the use of a too low index number	the impression greater weights could be placed in the aft sections of the cabin than would otherwise be allowable
action	carbon monoxide poisoning
Leaks in the heater shroud	carbon monoxide gas contaminate cockpit and cabin air
The captain 's carboxyhaemoglobin level was 17.9 per cent	his performance
