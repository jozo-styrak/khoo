During the required idle engine run , the fuel pressure and low fuel-flow rate , combined with minimal engine vibration , were insufficient to simulate in-flight conditions	, the LP fuel line did not detach from the fuel/oil heat exchanger , despite the missing retainer
run performed after the maintenance work had been completed would have greatly increased the probability of detecting the incorrect installation	The fuel leak resulted in a large vapour trail , noticeable to other aircraft crew and observers on the ground -LRB- see Appendix A -RRB-
the conflict in written tasks between the job board and the aircraft logbook	combined with the technicians not using the TSM to resolve the problem , the LP fuel line to the fuel/oil heat exchanger was unnecessarily disconnected
the retainer , which can not be removed from the fuel line , slid down the fuel line and became obscured from view	arrive
the retainer was missing	As the engine power levers were advanced for take-off , an increase in fuel pressure , flow rate , and , perhaps , engine vibration caused the LP fuel line to detach from the fuel/oil heat exchanger
this alert	it could have taken some time for the pilots to detect that the fuel was disappearing , since there was no indication of a fuel problem from on-board equipment
an incorrect entry on the maintenance office duty board and because technicians did not follow the TSM	they unnecessarily removed the LP fuel line from the fuel/oil heat exchanger
the retainer was hidden from view , and because they did not refer to the AMM , the technicians did not properly reconnect the LP fuel line	Because the technicians were unfamiliar with the coupling ,
causing a substantial fuel leak from the number 2 engine	detach
Also not used was a developer	detecting fuel leaks easier
an increase in fuel pressure , flow rate , and , perhaps , engine vibration	the LP fuel line
The fuel leak	a large vapour trail
A high-power ground run performed after the maintenance work had been completed	the probability of detecting the incorrect installation
Implementation of this SB	the risk of fuel exhaustion , engine shutdown and fire
Upon the application of take-off power , the fuel pressure , the fuel flow rate , and engine vibration caused the fuel/oil heat exchanger LP fuel line to detach	a substantial fuel leak from the number 2 engine
Upon the application of take-off power , the fuel pressure , the fuel flow rate , and engine vibration	the fuel/oil heat exchanger LP fuel line to detach , causing a substantial fuel leak from the number 2 engine
A high-power engine run was not performed by the operator -LRB- nor was one required by the engine manufacturer -RRB-	conditions similar to those that caused the LP fuel line to detach from the fuel/oil heat exchanger on take-off
was one required by the engine manufacturer -RRB- , which would have produced conditions similar to those	the LP fuel line
A high-powered engine run	the risk a leak or mis-installed component would go undetected
A proper inspection of the LP fuel line connection was not accomplished after the engine run-up	the risk a leak or mis-installed component would go undetected
Implementing this SB would reduce the risk that a fuel leak could go undetected	fuel exhaustion , engine failure , or fire
this SB	the risk a fuel leak could go undetected , leading to fuel exhaustion , engine failure , or fire
