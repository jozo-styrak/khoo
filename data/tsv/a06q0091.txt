Considering the circumstances , it was reasonable to anticipate an engine failure	, it would have been prudent to wait until a qualified AME examined the helicopter before taking off from the marsh
The rear part of the skids touched the ground during autorotation , indicating that the helicopter was not levelled at the time of the landing	, the helicopter nose tipped forward after landing , causing the tail to lift , which was then damaged by the main rotor
this temperature	it is normal for oil to dissipate rapidly , by evaporation and burning
the oil did not return to the tank	the oil temperature did not change , or at least not significantly
the metallurgical	examination , the cause of their failure
the oil pressure was fluctuating within the allowable limits but the oil temperature was normal	an immediate landing was not required according to the RFM
the accessibility to the road	It would thus have been preferable to land on the road one kilometre away from the marsh
the engine defect was internal	no oil leak was visible
the surface of a marsh	which is naturally soft , does not offer level bearing capacity , it is probable that the aircraft was not level , thereby altering the apparent oil level in the tank
the oil temperature was normal	The procedure recommended in the flight manual regarding engine oil fluctuation within the limits led the pilot to believe that the abnormal condition was not very serious
The oil that burned away did not return to the tank and , after a short time , the oil level became very low	the engine oil
The damage to bearings 6 and 7 was so severe that it was impossible to determine conclusively	the results of the metallurgical examination , the cause of their failure
Bell Helicopter	the pilot to extend the flight to the nearest location suitable for landing
The procedure recommended in the flight manual regarding engine oil fluctuation within the limits	the pilot to believe that the abnormal condition was not very serious since the oil temperature was normal
a defective gauge	the fluctuating engine oil pressure
the marsh 's inaccessibility and the infestation of mosquitoes	the pilot 's decision to move the helicopter to the road
Consequently , the helicopter nose tipped forward after landing	the tail lift , which was then damaged by the main rotor
The bearings were destroyed for undetermined reasons	an engine failure
the helicopter towards the road when the engine was showing signs of malfunction	the failure of bearings 6 and 7
During the autorotation , the helicopter was not levelled at the time of the landing	a hard landing
Consequently , a pilot could decide to continue the flight with a defective engine oil circulation system	the engine to fail or malfunction
