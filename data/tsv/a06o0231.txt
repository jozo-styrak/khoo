The horizon to the east was darker than the horizon to the north or south	, while it would be relatively easy to identify that the wings were level , it would be more difficult to identify whether the nose was in a level-flight attitude
160 hours over the previous seven years	The pilot had extensive flight experience and had flown the Pitts S1S
there is no way to determine where the pilot was looking as he turned toward the setting sun	the amount of dark adaptation required can not be quantified
it minimized the amount of time that the pilot had to recognize and correct any errors as he completed the roll	The low altitude is significant
There were no identifiable problems with the aircraft , the pilot was fit for the intended flight , and the autopsy did not reveal any pre-existing medical conditions	the accident
It was significantly darker to the east	the horizon more difficult to distinguish in that direction
Two factors	the accident were the light conditions and the low altitude at which the roll man uvre was initiated
The low light conditions	it more difficult for the pilot to identify the exact attitude of the aircraft in a dynamic man uvre such as a roll
The varying light conditions during man uvring	it difficult for the pilot to detect that the aircraft was descending
