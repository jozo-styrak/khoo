Although the pilot in the left seat was fully responsible for the flight , both pilots must have been in agreement when planning the trip and itinerary	reasonable to believe that the decisions concerning the flight were made jointly
why the pilot changed his plans 30 minutes later , filed a flight plan , and left for Qu bec are unknown	At 1500 , the pilot had decided to postpone the return flight until the next day
Even if VFR night flight was allowable , the area being flown over and the weather conditions taken together , likely did not allow the pilot to identify landmarks and to navigate by map	, although he could fly at night , it is unlikely that the pilot would have taken off without being sure that he could reach his destination if he could not see any visual landmarks
Because it was night , it was probably difficult to see the poor conditions before entering them	due to airframe icing during the flight were found
The aircraft was slowed by impacts with the trees in the final moments	, the aircraft speed at the time of the impact was higher than the reading on the anemometer -LRB- 150 knots -RRB-
Although the pilot in the left seat was fully	the flight , both pilots must have been in agreement when planning the trip and itinerary
and left Gasp as initially planned	improve
1500	the pilot had decided to postpone the return flight until the next day
he could not see any visual landmarks	As a result , although he fly at night , it is unlikely that the pilot would have taken off without being sure that he could reach his destination
it became necessary	It also be concluded that the pilot intended to use the GPS as the primary means of navigation
it was night	it was probably difficult to see the poor conditions before entering them
airframe icing during the flight were found	No aerodynamic effects
the angle of descent was greater than the aircraft 's nose-up angle	The pilot may have started a spiral recovery just before the collision
the pilot did not have the visibility needed to see the terrain	According to the evidence , the descending turn ended in a collision with the ground
debris struck the reset button , interrupting transmission	The emergency locator transmitter -LRB- ELT -RRB- did not transmit an emergency signal , probably
the forecast for the next day	the return flight
the following factors	his decision
good conditions above Gasp and during the previous flight poor forecasts for VFR flight the next day	an additional delay desire
a GPS on board	the pilot 's decision to take off with the risk of encountering marginal conditions at best
impacts with the trees in the final moments	aircraft
the aircraft instruments	the pilot to maintain a normal attitude and follow a heading
the instrument flight experience of both pilots	spatial disorientation and the resulting spiral
The pilot 's lack of experience combined with poor weather conditions	spatial disorientation that led to a loss of control
The pilot 's lack of experience combined with poor weather conditions resulted in spatial disorientation	a loss of control
a global positioning system -LRB- GPS -RRB- on board	the pilot 's decision to take off even though poor visual flight rules -LRB- VFR -RRB- conditions were forecast along the route
