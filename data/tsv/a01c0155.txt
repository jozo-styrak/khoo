ACA3578 had just requested direct to Marathon , and the controller did not confirm the routing on the ACA3578 flight progress strip	, the controller 's mental picture of the track of ACA3578 was eastward from Red Lake , likely replacing any previous knowledge of the flight-planned route to Sioux Lookout
Consequently , the controller 's mental picture of the track of ACA3578 was eastward from Red Lake , likely replacing any previous knowledge of the flight-planned route to Sioux Lookout	, he assessed that ACA3578 would not conflict with NWA853 at FL370
The controller circled the flight progress strip altitude in red but did not issue instructions to offset NWA853 from the airway	A second defence against risk of collision was
From 2024:58 until 2026:30 , the controller was occupied with activities related to the wrong-way altitude for NWA853 and the direct routing for ACA3578	his attention was likely diverted from monitoring traffic on the IM at a time when a conflict between NWA853 and ACA3578 could have been more easily resolved
When NWA853 requested a climb to FL370 , the controller used the PTL function to assess the situation	, he was aware of a potential conflict with ACA3578
NWA853 requested a climb to FL370	the controller used the PTL function to assess the situation
PTLs are based on current track and ground speed rather than a flight-planned track	the PTL for ACA3578 extended east past Red Lake , rather than southeast toward Sioux Lookout
the controller approved a wrong-way altitude for NWA853	this defence was negated
no second controller was performing data position duties	the controller 's workload was increased and the time available for flight monitoring was reduced
these activities	his attention was likely diverted from monitoring traffic on the IM at a time when a conflict between NWA853 and ACA3578 could have been more easily resolved
other defences in place , such as automated conflict alerting or a second controller working the data position	the controller 's attention was not directed back to a developing conflict
the controller 's attention was directed back to the IM	he recognized a conflict and took measures to separate the aircraft
The crew were not expecting a descent clearance , nor were they aware of oncoming traffic	, the controller 's issuance of a descent clearance was not compelling enough to trigger an immediate corrective response
the independent operation of TCAS	the controller could not know when a TCAS RA would occur and also could not know that the TCAS RA would contradict instructions he issued
each crew decided independently on their course of action , there was a chance that one crew would follow the controller 's instructions and that the other crew would follow the TCAS commands , thereby negating the defence of complementary TCAS commands and increasing the risk of collision	Because TCAS and ATC are not coordinated and
approving	the wrong-way altitude for NWA853 and by coordinating a direct routing for ACA3578
monitoring the flight paths of NWA853 and ACA3578	High workload reduced the time available
the time of the occurrence	an automated conflict alerting system was not available to alert Canadian controllers of impending air traffic conflicts
the controller did not use standard safety alert phraseology	The time that the two aircraft were exposed to a risk of collision was increased
TCAS and air traffic control are not coordinated	Risk of collision was increased
they were contradictory to instructions the controller had already issued	Each flight crew independently decided to disregard the TCAS resolution advisory commands
the time of the occurrence	there was no standback supervision in the Winnipeg specialty
PTLs are	current track and ground speed rather than a flight-planned track
Vertical separation of aircraft travelling in opposite directions	a defence against loss of separation
ATC MANOPS	an additional procedural defence of a red circle around the flight progress strip altitude and 5 nm track offsets when a wrong-way altitude is in use
the controller 's workload	assistance before or at the time of the occurrence
the controller 's workload was	and
steps	a direct routing ACA3578
The initial use of a descent clearance , rather than safety alert phraseology	the time needed to achieve the required spacing between the two aircraft and increased the time the two aircraft were at risk
the time needed to achieve the required spacing between the two aircraft	the time
TCAS operates independently of ATC	complementary RAs for each aircraft involved
the defence of complementary TCAS commands	the risk of collision
He	his workload by approving the wrong-way altitude for NWA853 and by coordinating a direct routing for ACA3578
High workload	the time available for monitoring the flight paths of NWA853 and ACA3578
The Winnipeg specialty was understaffed by two controllers	increased workload for controllers on duty
The practice of combining radar and data positions in a sector	the opportunity to detect conflicts and take timely action to prevent losses of separation
timely action	losses of separation
