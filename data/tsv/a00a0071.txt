No discrepancies were found with either the aircraft or the engine that would explain why the aircraft failed to accelerate ; however , the temperature and the dewpoint were such that serious carburettor icing could occur at any power setting	, it is probable that ice built up in the carburettor during the long taxi from the Academy ramp to position on runway 01
serious carburettor icing could occur at any power setting	the aircraft failed to accelerate ; however , the temperature and the dewpoint were such
the aircraft was not accelerating normally	the pilot did not abort the take-off as soon as it became apparent
This condition	a power loss , which might have been apparent to the pilot before taking-off , had he stopped the aircraft , applied the brakes , and set full power before commencing the take-off run
The following conditions	his decision making
Differences in physiology between the four individuals and differences in impact forces at the four seat positions	it difficult to compare the injuries suffered by the four individuals
the passengers ' use of the available seat belts and shoulder harnesses	more serious injuries
the general knowledge that seat belts and shoulder harnesses	injuries
Conditions	serious carburettor icing at any engine power setting
These conditions	the aircraft accelerating normally and from attaining safe flying speed
