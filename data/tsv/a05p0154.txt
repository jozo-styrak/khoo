However , if the pilot did not closely monitor the engine instruments , the formation of carburetor ice would initially be hidden while the governor was maintaining a constant manifold pressure and engine rpm	, whenever icing conditions are suspected , the pilot must apply carburetor heat as required
the pilot did not closely monitor the engine instruments	the formation of carburetor ice initially be hidden while the governor was maintaining a constant manifold pressure and engine rpm
both the tension microswitches and the extension limit switch failed to limit both the extension of the actuator and the increasing tension on the drive belts	This overloading occur
arcing of the GPS power wiring occurred	Failure of the temporary fastening lead to an electrical fire
The weather conditions at the time of the occurrence	icing
a mechanical fault or failure	the operation of the engine
carburetor ice	the engine
in the air in conditions	carburetor ice
the ice adversely affected engine performance	the engine stoppage
the ice	engine performance
the pilot was	the RPM
a 1.5-amp , in-line fuse over-current protection is required	the belt tension actuator overloading the drive belts
Failure of the temporary fastening	an electrical fire if arcing of the GPS power wiring occurred
carburetor ice adversely affected engine performance	the engine
carburetor ice	engine performance
the main rotor rpm decayed rapidly to an unrecoverable speed and the pilot was	the helicopter 's descent
Incorrect over-current fuse protection of the belt tension actuator	overloading of the drive belts
Failure of the temporary fastening	an electrical fire
