The 10 bank to the left at 65 feet , in combination with the reduced forward visibility , impeded the pilots ' ability to judge the aircraft 's orientation to the runway	, the aircraft touched down left of the centreline and ran off the edge of the runway
There were insufficient visual cues during the landing phase to enable the pilots to judge the aircraft 's orientation to the runway	, the aircraft landed left of the centreline and failed to remain on the runway
the weather conditions at the time of the occurrence	it is possible that freezing fog swirling around the aircraft could have created the illusion of movement about the aircraft
the downward vision angle	While the prevailing visibility was above the minimum value allowed to conduct an approach , the effective visibility
freezing fog swirling around the aircraft	the illusion of movement about the aircraft
the minimum value	to conduct an approach
There were insufficient visual cues during the landing phase	the pilots judge the aircraft 's orientation to the runway
The current regulations	approaches and landings
The current regulations allow for approaches and landings to be carried out in low visibility	the risk of an ineffective transition visual flight
