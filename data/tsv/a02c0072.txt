The weather radar display in the aircraft was attenuated and the air traffic controllers ' radar displays contained limited weather information	, the crew , and the air traffic controllers who were directing them , did not have an accurate picture of the severity of the weather in the terminal area
they were in visual contact with the ground and ATIS indicated that the active runway was Runway 36	The crew anticipated a visual approach to land on Runway 36 ,
the captain flew the approach and did not initiate a pilot-monitored approach	he lost some supervisory overview of the situation
the	crosswind
weather conditions precluded instrument approaches for Runway 36	the airport controller arranged to use Runway 13
The approach change and the adverse weather conditions increased the crew 's workload during the approach	it more difficult for the crew to properly position the aircraft for landing
The approach change and the adverse weather conditions	the crew 's workload during the approach
Doppler radar	this information
The aircraft landed to the right of centre line	the likelihood it would depart the runway under the prevailing crosswind conditions
The amount of rain which had fallen likely	a sufficient moisture film aircraft hydroplaning
The crosswind and tailwind conditions	the likelihood the aircraft would hydroplane after touchdown on Runway 13
The aircraft landed during heavy precipitation on a wet runway , and it likely hydroplaned	a loss of directional control and runway excursion
