This report concludes the TSB 's investigation into this occurrence	, the Board authorized the release of this report on 19 September 2002
fretting	wear between the second-stage ring gear and the magnesium mating splines of the RGB case
the friction to a point where the oil immediately surrounding the particle will breakdown , depositing a thin carbonaceous layer around the particle	The magnesium dust particles are heated
excessive fretting of the RGB housing splines	Implementation of these inspections and compliance with the service bulletin have been successful : there have been no reported catastrophic failures
was turned on demanded a large electrical load	idle -LRB- 65 % Ng -RRB- , and the equipment
the engine was able to accelerate from ground idle to flight idle speed with the electrical equipment already selected	it is likely that the 300-A draw and the engine power loss were coincidental and that the draw did not contribute to engine power loss
The engine power loss and fretting of the RGB case mating splines were not considered an engine failure	did not affect the engine 's reliability record
the mating splines of the RGB case	magnesium dust particles being released into the engine oil
Inspection of the fuel system did not reveal any sign of water , and testing and disassembly of the FCU , fuel pump , and flow divider did not reveal any anomalies	the power loss
the generator	to meet the demands of charging the battery and running the equipment
Once flight idle -LRB- 75 % Ng -RRB- was selected , the generator was more able to meet these demands	a 300-A draw on the amperage gauge
the generator was	these demands , which resulted in a 300-A draw on the amperage gauge
the draw did	engine power loss
case	a magnesium count in the engine oil
The electrical power draw did	the engine power loss
