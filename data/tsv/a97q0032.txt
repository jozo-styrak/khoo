the nut -LRB- AN-7 -RRB- was not tight enough	It is possible that this situation was aggravated
the bungee failed	it allowed the ski to continue rotating
the same time	the ski continued to rotate rapidly toward its physical limit , exerting downward force on the landing gear leg

complying with ADs rests with the person who has legal control of the aircraft unless that responsibility is specifically delegated in a document setting out the agreement	The CARs provide that the responsibility
