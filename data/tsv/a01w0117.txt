this point	the pilot flying decreased the body angle and the descent rate increased to about 1080 fpm
the TLA position , the ground spoilers did not deploy	The aircraft touched down with a high sink rate , and ,
the captain took control , retarded the throttles , and lowered the nose to minimize the bounce	the nose-down control deflection resulted in the aircraft landing nosewheel first
The approach profile	data from the flight data recorder
the pilot flying	the body angle and the descent rate increased to about 1080 fpm
The combination of power application , high sink rate , and the lack of spoiler deployment	the aircraft rebounding
The actions taken to correct the bounce	a rebound
the nose-down control deflection	the aircraft landing nosewheel
on the control column	a further bounce
in time	a bounced landing and a subsequent bounced landing
The power increase during the flair	the speedbrake/spoilers retracting
