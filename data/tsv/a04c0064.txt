During the accident flight , it is likely that the horizontal stabilizer separated while the helicopter was cruising at speeds in excess of 70 mph	the tail of the helicopter to pitch up
Forces produced by the sudden upward movement of the tail boom bent the main rotor blades down	tail structure interference with the main rotor disc -LRB- see Photos 3 and 4 -RRB-
Continued rotation and mast bumping of the main rotor blades destroyed the bubble canopy	the in-flight break up of the helicopter
It is likely that during ground impact the forward protruding rotor blade was forced up	an overload failure of the rotor spar
The separation of the tail-rotor blade	an excessive amount of vibration in the stabilizer , when combined with the 22-inch arm of the airfoil , bent the stabilizer spar at the root end
the tail-rotor blade separation and tail-rotor strikes	vibrations
operation of the helicopter	continued fatigue cracking
Separation of the tail-rotor blade during a previous flight had induced an excessive amount of vibration in the stabilizer	bending of the horizontal stabilizer spar
Separation of the tail-rotor blade during a previous flight	an excessive amount of vibration in the stabilizer
Cold straightening the stabilizer spar , which was not a recommended maintenance practice , concentrated stresses at the first rivet hole	fatigue cracking
Separation of the horizontal stabilizer resulted in a loss of control and in a sudden upward pitch of the tail boom	the bending of the rotor blades
Separation of the horizontal stabilizer	a loss of control
in the bending of the rotor blades	interference of the tail-boom structure with the rotor disc
