The lack of visual cues inherent at night in poorly lit areas	night flying , take-offs , and landings challenging
the dark lighting conditions of the surrounding area and the approach over the dark surface of the lake	ideal conditions the black hole illusion
The pilot unknowingly flew the helicopter lower than the intended approach path	the helicopter to collide with the surface of the water well before reaching the desired landing area
a helicopter is away from obstacles	a shallower approach to land
Flying over the lake on approach at night	a helicopter is away from obstacles and allows for a shallower approach to land
more than a few minutes	the cold water temperatures
It is likely that the effect of the black hole illusion caused the pilot , in full control of the aircraft , to unknowingly fly the helicopter lower than the intended approach path	the helicopter to collide with the surface of the water well before reaching the desired landing area
the effect of the black hole illusion	the pilot
Current regulations do not specify light intensity , colour , number of lights , or approach path aids for private helicopter landing pads	the risk of accidents or incidents in degraded environmental conditions
