Warm air can hold more moisture than cold air	, with time , the warm air entering the cabin via the ceiling diffusers would have allowed the temperature of the windshield to rise to a point where the water vapour contained in the warm air from the ducting would not transform into water droplets
At this point , the windshield would then start to clear	, had the demist been selected while flying at a higher altitude , it is likely that the fogged windshield would have cleared in enough time for the pilot to notice and to correct the descent prior to striking the water surface
there was no place to land along the shoreline	if the helicopter had been flown closer to it , the risk associated with swimming long distances in cold water have been reduced
the pilot selected demist hot air to clear the windshield	the warm air from the ceiling ventilation ducting was instantly cooled when it hit the relatively cooler windshield
any outside visual cues	the pilot did not perceive that the helicopter was descending from 100 feet agl
this point	the windshield would then start to clear
the demist been selected while flying at a higher altitude	it is likely that the fogged windshield would have cleared in enough time for the pilot to notice and to correct the descent prior to striking the water surface
The pilot encountered unexpected conditions of reduced visibility in moderate to heavy rain showers in the vicinity of Lac l' paule	him find a safe landing spot to wait for the weather to improve
This	a shallower approach
This rapid cooling	the air to condense and fogged the windshield and front side windows
He did not have time to open the bad weather window	him some outside visibility
the warm air entering the cabin via the ceiling diffusers	the temperature of the windshield to rise to a point where the water vapour contained in the warm air from the ducting would not transform into water droplets
No documentation cautions EC 120 flight crews about the risk associated with the selection of demist during certain critical phases of flight , which can , under certain weather conditions	a temporary loss of outside visibility
The pilot encountered unexpected conditions of reduced visibility in moderate to heavy rain showers and low ceiling conditions	him land
He did not have time to open the bad weather window	him some outside visibility
the demist system	a temporary loss of outside visibility
Selection of the demist while flying at a higher altitude	the windshield to clear sufficiently in time for the pilot to notice and correct any undesired change in the aircraft 's flight parameters
