While it is possible that arcing in the electrical control system could cause a loss of engine rpm , it would be extremely difficult to differentiate between pre-impact and submersion-related arcing	, the electrical system was not investigated further
Neither the fuel quality nor the fuel quantity was a likely factor in the occurrence	of submersion of the helicopter precluded post-occurrence engine run testing
flight loads reduced the engine rpm to below 99 % and the engine began operating on the acceleration schedule	The pilot was aware that the engine decelerate
the pilot had his head out of the side window	he did not see the engine rpm indicated on the gauge
the helicopter was in a stable hover and it was not lifting a heavy load	The helicopter engine should have been operating at greater that 99 % rpm and should not have been operating on the acceleration schedule
the fuel supply for the helicopter and the fuel in the fuel line to the engine-driven pump were found to be uncontaminated	it is unlikely that the engine power loss resulted from fuel contamination

the engine could not be ground run or test run with the components in place , it was not feasible to assess the combined effect of these anomalies	However ,

to the fuel quantity in the helicopter	it unlikely the power loss resulted from fuel starvation
in the electrical control system	a loss of engine rpm
Testing of the fuel control , the Tt2 sensor , the fuel pump , and the flow divider valve at their respective manufacture facilities did not disclose conditions	a loss of engine power
none of these individual anomalies	an uncommanded loss of engine power
their combined effect	a complete loss of engine power
The operating parameters at the time of the occurrence	the cause of the loss of engine power
