was found for the first engine power loss on the day of the accident	No mechanical reason was found for the first engine power loss on the day of the accident
the aircraft 's engine ran smoothly after water was drained from its fuel system	it is likely that the engine power loss during the first attempted take-off resulted from fuel contamination
the low ice accretion rate during the take-off phase	It is unlikely that any significant amount of carburettor ice accumulated in the carburettor
most of the fuel had escaped	the amount of water contamination in the fuel system before impact could not be accurately assessed
nor from which a safe landing could be made	restart
water contamination in the fuel	The aircraft 's engine power loss during the first attempted take-off was likely
Impact damage	the loss of all but a very small amount of fuel from the centre tank
Damage to the tanks and sumps during the impact	water contamination in the area to escape
The water would then have shifted its position during take-off , entered fuel lines and migrated to the carburettor and into the engine	a loss of power
the fuel entered the engine	it regain power
in the most likely accident scenario -- fuel contamination -- working the throttle operated the accelerator pump in the carburettor	the movement of fuel through the system
the pilot 's action	the engine restart once clean fuel was available
Differences in physiology between the two individuals and differences in impact forces at the two seat positions	it difficult to draw comparisons between the origin of the injuries suffered by the two crew members
the pilot 's use of the available shoulder harness likely	more serious injuries during the impact sequence
The most likely accident scenario during the second take-off is that water contamination migrated from the centre fuel tank to the engine	a loss of engine power
Examination of the aircraft and testing of the engine and components did not identify any pre-occurrence structural , mechanical , or electrical defects or malfunctions	this occurrence
The pilot 's use of his shoulder harness	more serious injuries during the impact sequence
