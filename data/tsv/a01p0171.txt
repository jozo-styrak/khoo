The radar controller and the data controller did not identify the developing traffic conflict until , at the handoff , the Comox controller apprised the radar controller of the conflict	, the radar controller had little time to manoeuvre the aircraft effectively to reduce the risk of collision
The radar controller twice used the wrong call sign for C-GKOS when he issued corrective instructions	, the pilot received the descent instructions too late to reduce the risk of collision
The radar controller and the data controller did not mark the flight progress strips to indicate the potential conflict , either when the estimate for C-GKOS was initially passed to Comox or when C-GKOS was cleared to maintain 17 000 feet	, the likelihood of detecting the conflict during a later scan of the strips was reduced
at that time he did not accurately assess the relative positions	and the progress of the two flights toward each other
there was no attempt to assess the relative positions of the two aircraft where the tracks would cross	When the data controller passed an estimate and an altitude for C-GKOS to Comox , the flight progress strips were not annotated to indicate a conflict ,
the data controller passed an estimate and an altitude for C-GKOS to Comox	the flight progress strips were not annotated to indicate a conflict , because there was no attempt to assess the relative positions of the two aircraft where the tracks would cross
the use of the available display tools	neither the information on flight progress strips nor on the radar display was compelling enough to alert the controllers to the potential conflict
he was required to display a large range to ensure the entire airspace for which he had responsibility	the radar targets of the two aircraft were likely so close that they were overlapping to some extent
the radar controller used the correct call sign when he first issued the instruction to C-GKOS to descend and had the collision geometry remained constant	the descent instruction
the altitude change occurred after the aircraft flight paths had crossed	The radar controller 's evasion instruction issued to and by C-GKOS was , however , ineffective
However , the line of relative bearing had , by this time , begun to increase because C-GKOS had accelerated to cruising speed	, the risk of collision dissolved
this error added to the delay before	the pilot received and actioned the altitude instruction
Radar data show that C-GKOS began to descend about 20 seconds after the pilot received the clearance to maintain 15 000 feet	, the pilot likely did not associate any degree of urgency to the altitude instruction
hearing	the communications between the radar controller and VAL712 about the TCAS alert and the proposed descent to 15 000 feet
using the word immediately -RRB- or pointed out the conflicting traffic	the pilot of C-GKOS would have been alerted to the developing situation and could have employed a more aggressive or earlier evasive descent
the radar controller did not use imperative radio phraseology with the C-GKOS pilot	the timely response the controller had expected did not take place
The chain of events	this loss of separation and ultimately to the risk of collision comprised deficiencies in controller planning , executing , and monitoring , and a breakdown of the radar controller 's situational awareness -LRB- a mental picture of relevant traffic -RRB-
His difficulties were	more complex
a large range	the entire airspace for which he had responsibility
This proximity or overlap	it difficult to quickly determine the exact lateral relationship between the two aircraft and to issue a suitable vector to resolve the conflict
about the time he cleared C-GKOS to 17 000 feet	a loss of separation between the two aircraft
