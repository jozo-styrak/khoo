Crosswind turbulence would also have reduced aircraft performance during initial climb	, the aircraft did not attain its best rate of climb airspeed after take-off , and did not have enough altitude to be able to descend in order to accelerate after the loss of engine power
The pilot maintained airspeed above the minimum single-engine control speed and directed the aircraft to a safer landing site	, it can be concluded that the pilot 's action in securing the engine and propeller and continuing flight was appropriate under the circumstances
The length of the take-off run and the timing of the engine power loss did not allow the aircraft to accelerate to its best single-engine rate of climb airspeed	, the aircraft did not climb after the engine power loss
The aircraft was not equipped with seat-belt extensions to accommodate all the passengers who required them	, one passenger was not restrained during the flight , increasing the risk of injury
setting full engine power -LRB- throttles - full forward , check manifold pressure 43 inches -RRB- would have produced a higher engine power output on take-off than the operator 's method of setting take-off power	The AFM procedure
reducing	manifold pressure and engine power during take-off
As a result , the aircraft did not attain its best rate of climb airspeed after take-off , and did not have enough altitude to be able to descend	accelerate after the loss of engine power
leaning	the fuel-air mixture
this occurrence	The pilot 's selection of the forced-landing site in a marsh reduced the risk of injuries or fatalities
The AFM procedure for setting full engine power -LRB- throttles - full forward , check manifold pressure 43 inches -RRB-	a higher engine power output
The airport elevation and the higher-than-standard ambient temperatures would have increased induction temperatures	induction air density
The airport elevation and the higher-than-standard ambient temperatures	induction temperatures
The lift-off , near the departure end of the runway	a limited distance aircraft acceleration and climb
Crosswind turbulence	aircraft performance during initial climb
The increased drag resulting from low airspeed	the aircraft 's performance , from the value provided in the AFM , to the point where it was barely able to maintain airspeed in level flight and
The pilot 's decision to force-land the aircraft in the marsh	him maintain control and place the aircraft in a landing site where its speed could be gradually dissipated and the aircraft would not submerge
control	the aircraft in a landing site
These actions	the risk of injury passengers during the forced landing
These anomalies	available engine power at a critical time in the take-off sequence

The aircraft 's seat belts and seat-belt extension were not sufficient to restrain all the passengers	the risk of injury during a forced landing
The aircraft 's seat belts and seat-belt extension were	all the passengers
The aircraft was	an island
Its equipment was not adequate for a water landing	the risk occupants during the over-water portion of the planned flight had such a landing become necessary
This reduced engine power during take-off , and combined with the gravel runway and rolling take-off	an increased take-off distance
This	engine power during take-off
The right-engine turbocharger differential pressure controller malfunctioned at a critical time in the take-off sequence	a loss of engine power
As a result , one passenger was not restrained during the flight	the risk of injury
The aircraft was not adequately equipped for over-water operation	the risk the occupants during such operations
The pilot 's selection of the forced-landing site in a marsh	the risk of injuries or fatalities as a result of this occurrence
