The possibility that another mast nut was installed before the take-off and came loose in flight was rejected because all the mast nuts in inventory were found in the S.C.G. H licopt re inc. hangar	, the aircraft took off with no mast nut
It is unlikely the AME thought that the mast nut had been installed by the apprentice AME or by his partner because the AME had received no notification or indication that the work had been completed	, it is reasonable to believe that the three persons who took part in the removal of the mast nut , and who were present when the aircraft took off , did not remember that the mast nut was in the hangar
Also , the missing mast nut undoubtedly would have been noticed by the pilot if a pre-flight check had been done as specified in the aircraft flight manual	, it is reasonable to conclude that the pilot did not climb atop the aircraft and did not examine the rotor head
the mast nut was not in place	Examination of the rotor head and its components indicates that the main rotor separated from the aircraft
all the mast nuts in inventory were found in the S.C.G. H licopt re inc. hangar	The possibility that another mast nut was installed before the take-off and came loose in flight was rejected
the AME had received no notification or indication that the work had been completed	It is unlikely the AME thought that the mast nut had been installed by the apprentice AME or by his partner
a document had indicated the work that remained to be done and if the AME had consulted that document before the flight	It is unlikely that the helicopter have taken off without the mast nut
it was not anticipated by the maintenance personnel	The occurrence flight expedited the work to be done on the helicopter
a pre-flight check had been done as specified in the aircraft flight manual	Also , the missing mast nut undoubtedly have been noticed by the pilot
The AME	the maintenance of C-GFSE was on board the aircraft when it took off and had worked with the pilot during the hours preceding the flight
the mast nut was not in place	The main-rotor head separated in flight
Maintenance personnel could have referred to the documents	the aircraft taking off
this	the pilot a false sense of security
