The landing gear in the down position likely contributed to the aircraft pitching forward on landing	bent the forward section of the right float upward and into the arc of the propeller , resulting in the damage to all three propeller blade tips
the airframe damage , an electrical arc or a heat source -LRB- such as the engine exhaust -RRB- ignited the fuel leaking from the left wing root	The most likely scenario is that ,
airframe damage during the forced landing	The aircraft was destroyed by fire , most likely as a result of a fuel leak that started
100 LL and Jet B were of the same size and shape , increasing the risk of using the wrong type of fuel	The fuel delivery nozzles
landing straight ahead after the power loss	a runway overrun and probable collision with the road or a ditch
The forced landing in the adjacent field	a smoother landing surface with reduced impact forces
The crew 's use of the seatbelts , shoulder harnesses , and cargo net	more serious injuries
the landing gear	his decision to fly a circuit for an immediate return to Runway 20
Leaving the landing gear down increased drag	it more difficult to maintain flight
the landing gear down	drag
The landing gear in the down position	the aircraft pitching forward on landing
The initial impact bent the forward section of the right float upward and into the arc of the propeller	the damage to all three propeller blade tips
Separation of the propeller from the engine	the engine rpm run away or increase
Twisting and distortion of the airframe during the roll-over either dislodged or cracked the fuel line at the left wing root	a steady stream of fuel
Water contamination in the fuel	the corrosion of the fuel
Corrosion particles then migrated to the No. 1 fuel injector during operation	fuel flow the No. 1 cylinder
This restricted fuel flow caused the No. 1 cylinder to stop firing	the engine power loss
This restricted fuel flow	the No. 1 cylinder to stop firing
Water in the fuel	intermittent fuel delivery to the engine and partial fuel starvation
Water in the fuel probably resulted in intermittent fuel delivery to the engine and partial fuel starvation	deteriorating engine power at take-off
A restriction in the No. 1 fuel injector resulting from corrosion of the manifold screen caused the No. 1 cylinder to stop firing	the deteriorating engine power
A restriction in the No. 1 fuel injector resulting from corrosion of the manifold screen	the No. 1 cylinder to stop firing
The fuel delivery nozzles for 100 LL and Jet B were of the same size and shape	the risk of using the wrong type of fuel
