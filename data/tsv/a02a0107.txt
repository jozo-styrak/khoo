excessive speed	The captain reduced the engine power to idle 16 seconds prior to touchdown , likely because he recognised that the approach was in jeopardy
factors such as flare technique , braking technique , and differences between the actual runway conditions and estimated runway conditions	The discrepancy between the stopping distance calculated by the engineering landing simulation -LRB- 5940 feet -RRB- , and the actual stopping distance -LRB- 6400-7100 feet -RRB- may be
nine-knot tailwind into the landing calculations	the
the timing of this decision	the omission of the tailwind during the calculation of landing performance
the tailwind	it difficult to maintain a normal descent profile
The captain	the engine power to idle 16 seconds prior to touchdown
The excess speed would have exacerbated the effect of the tailwind	a further increase in the stopping distance
The excess speed	the effect of the tailwind
The combination of the high threshold crossing height , excessive approach and touchdown speeds , and the extended touchdown point	the aircraft
Some of the FDR parameters were faulty	erroneous recordings and difficulty in interpreting actual aircraft performance
The combination of the high threshold crossing height , excessive approach and touchdown speeds , and the extended touchdown point	the aircraft
