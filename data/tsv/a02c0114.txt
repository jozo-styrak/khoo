these hold-down nuts being properly tightened	there would be insufficient clamping force holding the starter/generator in place
the constant supply of fuel and ignition , it re-ignited after the retardant was spent	It is considered likely that the fire was momentarily suppressed , but
the fuel line was pinched against the vibrating starter/generator	it chafed through , allowing fuel to enter the starter/generator , which resulted in an engine fire
Fire damage to the engine indication electrical harness and interface disrupted the electrical system	the illumination of the master warning caution light , chip detector light
in the illumination of the master warning caution light , chip detector light	the oil pressure indication
The vibration chafed a hole through the fuel line	fuel dribble past the cooling fan cap of the starter/generator and onto the commutator
It is likely that heat generated by the starter/generator and sparks emitted by the commutator and brushes acted as an ignition source	a fire
the engine	fuel pressure in the chafed fuel line that kept feeding the fire
the vibration of the starter generator	the cooling fan cap screws to back out
After the cap separated , it was retained over the cooling fan blades by the pinched fuel line	abrasion of the cooling fan
The abrasion of the cooling fan	the failure of the fuel line
Three starter/generator hold-down nuts at the 12 , 10 and 8 o'clock positions were not fastened	the starter/generator to vibrate
Because the fuel line was pinched against the vibrating starter/generator , it chafed through , allowing fuel to enter the starter/generator	an engine fire
the fuel line was pinched against the vibrating starter/generator , it chafed through	fuel enter the starter/generator , which resulted in an engine fire
The vibration of the starter/generator induced the separation of the cooling fan cap	the abrasion of the cooling fan blades
The vibration of the starter/generator	the separation of the cooling fan cap
