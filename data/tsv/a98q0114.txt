the spring was missing , the aircraft was not airworthy	In reality ,
the logbooks reflected the defect and been available to the pilots	the flight instructor
no work was done on the rudder control system	No independent check was completed and Transport Canada maintains that this is not required in these circumstances
the aircraft no longer conformed to its type certification	In any event , the removal of the rudder return spring meant that the flight authority was no longer valid
closing	the horn
the direction of cable pull tends to close the mouth of the horn	increasing the jamming effect , applying right rudder force would only have tightened the jam rather than broken it
a higher altitude	the flight instructor 's chances of recovery from the spin in this occurrence
the failure to follow specified altitude restrictions for spin exercises	the risk of such operations
The requirement to conduct independent inspections is intended	a further check of an engine or flight control system has been disturbed during maintenance
The objective is	the likelihood the system is going to operate properly
The absence of the rudder bar return spring and its attachment bracket arguably	a disturbance to the flight control system which ought to have required an independent inspection
During the maintenance audit of the flight school operator at Saint-Hubert Airport , discrepancies were noted	the grounding of several aircraft , including five Cessna 152 aircraft with reported rudder over-traveling
the TSB , Transport Canada , Cessna , and Laurentide Aviation personnel on 22	findings regarding rudder over-traveling additional examinations and tests
the direction of cable pull tends	the jamming by closing the horn
a new rudder horn stop bolt assembly	protection against future jamming of the rudder
the crew	a full left deflection
The aircraft was released for flight with a rudder bar return spring missing , which , in combination with other factors	the rudder to lock in a full left deflection
the design and condition of the stop bolt and rudder horn stop plate	the stop plate over-travel the stop bolt and jam
Because the direction of cable pull tends to close the mouth of the horn	the jamming effect
