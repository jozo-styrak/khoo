the autopilot had been disconnected earlier by the PF	The pitch-up have been minimized
the flight crew noted the information depicted on the approach plate	it is likely that the PF would have been better prepared and reacted accordingly
the aircraft was not within 12 nm from the threshold , in compliance with ATS procedure	The flight crew was not directly informed of the possibility of glide path interference caused by a taxiing aircraft

Neither aircraft airworthiness nor environmental conditions	either event in this occurrence
A glide path signal was most probably distorted by a taxiing aircraft and provided erroneous information to the autopilot	a pitch-up event
by a taxiing aircraft	erroneous information the autopilot
A lack of situational awareness and airmanship	not detecting the incorrectly set speed
a taxiing aircraft	the possibility of glide path interference
The PF allowed the aircraft to climb 1000 feet during the pitch-up	a conflict with other aircraft
The PF	the aircraft to climb 1000 feet during the pitch-up , which could have caused a conflict with other aircraft
the flat authority gradient	a more relaxed attitude toward cross-checking each other 's actions or confirming other information
