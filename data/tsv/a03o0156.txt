During climb out from the departure airfield , it is likely the contaminants in the fuel servo either reached sufficient mass or migrated within the metering unit , such that outlet fuel pressure to the fuel injectors was restricted	, the servo could only supply sufficient fuel pressure to the injectors to sustain idle engine power
Examination of the fuel servo revealed water contamination and corrosion in the fuel metering unit of the servo , resulting in reduced outlet fuel pressure to the fuel injectors	The engine quit of the reduced fuel pressure , and the aircraft descended into the water
occurrence	this
the faulty transmitter	Turning the ELT on should have ensured the transmission of the emergency signal ; however , no emergency signal was transmitted
the reduced fuel pressure	The engine quit
the ELT on	the transmission of the emergency signal
the unserviceability of the ELT	the search
search and rescue personnel were	the aircraft from the information the pilot had provided during the distress call
The pilot 's medical condition and his not wearing a life vest	his inability to survive in the water
Examination of the fuel servo revealed water contamination and corrosion in the fuel metering unit of the servo	reduced outlet fuel pressure to the fuel injectors
Examination of the fuel servo	water contamination and corrosion in the fuel metering unit of the servo
The absence of a signal from the transmitter	the time required by search and rescue personnel to locate the aircraft
The water temperature and the additional physical exertion from treading water without support of the life vest	the rate of body temperature loss , which probably expedited the onset of hypothermia
his	chances for survival in the water
