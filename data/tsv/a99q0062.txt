The pilots of the occurrence aircraft were certified for the flight but had little instrument-flight experience	The pilots had not had the opportunity to fully acquire the essential skills to react immediately to spatial disorientation
they planned the flight	the weather information led them to believe that the ceiling would stay at an acceptable height
the prevailing weather conditions at the time of the approach	the runway was covered with a layer of snow , making it difficult to see
a false-horizon illusion	pilots can be led not to act correctly on the flight controls
low altitude	pilots have very little time to recognize an illusion and take appropriate corrective action
spatial	disorientation
It is likely that the pilot flying became disoriented and was unable to regain control of the situation	he flew the aircraft towards the ground after losing situational awareness
the impact	all damage
The engines were	power
the weather information	them believe that the ceiling would stay at an acceptable height
nothing in the regulations	them doing so
the environmental conditions and scarce visual ground references near Gasp Airport	disorientation
Given the prevailing weather conditions at the time of the approach , the runway was covered with a layer of snow	it difficult to see
Use of the aerodrome lighting system	the crew to better orient themselves
pilots	not to act correctly on the flight controls
The false-climb illusion , for its part	pilots push on the stick and put the aircraft in a nose-down attitude
Only instrument-flight training , experience , and practice	pilots acquire the skills needed to recognize and counter the effects of spatial disorientation
the pilot flying became disoriented	control of the situation
The environmental conditions and scarce visual ground references near Gasp Airport	disorientation
The pilot became disoriented during the overshoot	control of the situation
During the approach , the crew did not activate the aerodrome lighting system	worsening the pilot 's spatial disorientation
