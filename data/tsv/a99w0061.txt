The red battery temperature warning light is designed to alert the pilot to a battery thermal run-away condition , and is not intended to function primarily as a fire warning light	, the pilot initially believed that he had a battery over-temperature problem rather than an in-flight fire
Stress can have a positive or a negative effect on thinking and performance , depending on the circumstances and the individual	of emotional stress and anxiety is that an individual may concentrate on the difficulties that are creating the stress rather than on the practical aspects of the present situation
the auxiliary-battery-to-main-battery parallelling cable not being attached to the positive post of the main battery	The AS 355 F1 helicopter sustained an in-flight fire that occurred
the flammability of the survival gear in the baggage compartment	The analysis will also address the pilot 's actions and the propagation of the fire
any error	does occur
the changes	Since there was no requirement for TC to perform audits on the company , and
there was no cockpit indication to identify that the auxiliary battery parallelling cable was unattached	the helicopter was flown for some time with a serious maintenance discrepancy
turning off the battery in accordance with the recommended emergency procedures	continuing a slow descent towards a convenient precautionary landing site , and contemplating a precautionary landing
landing immediately	he reacted to the loss of electrical power and the appearance of smoke in the cockpit which were the second and more urgent indications of the in-flight emergency
the burning qualities of the packaging material and equipment	Propagation of the fire was rapid
emotional stress and anxiety is that an individual may concentrate	the difficulties that are creating the stress rather than on the practical aspects of the present situation
the	uncertainty of the merger may have contributed to the occurrence could not be determined
the helicopter was being operated as a private aircraft	helicopter maintenance was not required to be performed by an AMO
Several system defences	this accident
The auxiliary-battery-to-main-battery parallelling system	no cockpit indication the auxiliary battery was unattached
The analysis will therefore address the latent system failures that may have contributed to the maintenance error that occurred and the conditions	it remaining undetected
the latent system failures	the maintenance error that occurred and the conditions that resulted in it remaining undetected
Maintenance systems and practices have evolved	the likelihood of a maintenance error occurring and
the likelihood of a maintenance error occurring	the consequences of any error that does occur
seven years	did exist in the form of the company aircraft maintenance manual inadequate
The circumstance of having one battery cable normally attached to the positive post of the main battery on two of the company helicopters , and of having two battery cables normally attached to the positive post of the main battery on the other company helicopters	the potential for an auxiliary battery cable
The proximity of this equipment to the electrical wiring in the battery compartment	the initiation of the fire
One consequence of emotional stress and anxiety is that an individual may concentrate on the difficulties	the stress rather than
Hazards	the distraction of attention and the failure to recognize errors
The maintenance department 's three managerial policy changes in the year preceding the accident and the recent company merger	employee stress levels
the impact of the uncertainty of the merger	the occurrence could not be determined
However , it appears that stress and preoccupation with concerns about the future of the company may have affected the performance of one or both of the maintenance engineers who had most recently worked in the battery compartment	a situation of inattention the work being accomplished
stress and preoccupation with concerns about the future of the company	the performance of one
electrical wiring represented a hazard	the initiation and propagation of the in-flight fire
The risk that AMEs	errors in their work
