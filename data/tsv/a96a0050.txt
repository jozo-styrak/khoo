The engines had not spooled down to idle before the reversers were stowed	, the transition to forward thrust arrested the aircraft 's deceleration
the slippery runway surface condition	Braking effectiveness was reduced
the engines had not spooled down to idle reverse before the reversers were stowed	the resultant forward thrust was sufficient to arrest the deceleration and result in the runway excursion
reverse thrust was reselected	the idle reverse thrust on the left engine contributed to the increased rate of turn of the aircraft heading to the left
the brakes had been released	the increased tire cornering forces have helped to counteract the veer and maintain the aircraft on the runway
the engines spooled down to idle before the reversers were stowed	the aircraft might have stopped on the runway
the aircraft 's low forward airspeed	The rudder was ineffective in counteracting the veer
The runway 15 RVR was 6,000 feet	the flight crew see the departure end runway lighting at touchdown
the aircraft 's proximity to the end of the runway during deceleration	the crew continuing to use a high reverse thrust setting at a speed below that recommended by Canadair
The combination of the left crosswind , the slippery runway surface condition , and the high reverse thrust at low speed	the aircraft weathercocking left into the wind
deceleration	the runway excursion
the resultant forward thrust was	the deceleration and result in the runway excursion
the idle reverse thrust on the left engine	the increased rate of turn of the aircraft heading to the left
the increased tire cornering forces	to counteract the veer and maintain the aircraft on the runway
reverse thrust was	to idle reverse and
The TSB Engineering Branch and the aircraft manufacturer , Canadair , have each	a computer animation tape of the runway excursion , available on request from the TSB
the PF was	directional control of the aircraft at low speed
