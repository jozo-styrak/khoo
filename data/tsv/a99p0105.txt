These indicators also suggest that the initial impact was made as the blades were advancing on the left side of the aircraft	forces to the main rotor destroyed the rotor system , making the helicopter uncontrollable
Also , with current regulations , they have difficulty enforcing flight visibility regulations	, the accident pilot was operating with ineffective operational supervisory and regulatory defences with regard to poor weather operations
no indication was found of any malfunction or pre-existing mechanical defect	further analysis focusses on operational aspects of the accident flight
low visibility	The ravine was off the track that joined the lake and the airport , and since there were no apparent tourist attractions in the ravine , it is likely that the pilot flew into the ravine
the helicopter had gone this far up the ravine , it is likely that the flight visibility was 75 feet or less	When flying up the ravine abeam the accident site , the distance from the pilot 's seat to the site is about 75 feet ; and ,
he had limited experience	flying the AS350BA
the time of the accident	the visibility at the accident site was concluded to have been about 75 feet
The initial impact forces to the main rotor destroyed the rotor system	the helicopter uncontrollable
the pilot	the helicopter to a hover close terrain
TC inspectors are	pilot practices
While the helicopter was being manoeuvred close to terrain in poor visibility , the helicopter 's main rotor struck a rock	the helicopter uncontrollable
