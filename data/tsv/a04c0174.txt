The wear eventually allowed the roller to move beyond the cam cutout position	, the drag brace was primarily held in the down-and-locked position by the inboard bellcrank roller and the positioning cam , both of which were out of adjustment and held in position by spring tension only
The smaller diameter of the roller	the required clearance in relation the roller 's location on the heel of the positioning cam
The wear	the roller to move beyond the cam cutout position
The side loading	the left landing gear during the landing
The side loading placed on the left landing gear during the landing was sufficient to override the spring tension and snap the inboard roller beyond the cam cutout position	the landing gear collapse
The side loading placed on the left landing gear during the landing was	the spring tension
The smaller diameter roller reduced the required rigging tolerances for the bellcrank-to-cam assembly in the down-and-locked position and allowed the roller to eventually move beyond the cam cutout position	the collapse of the left landing gear
