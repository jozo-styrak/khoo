The reason for the excessive wear in the exhaust valve guides for cylinder numbers 3 and 5 remains unexplained	the excessive wear in the exhaust valve guides for cylinder numbers 3 and 5 remains
It is unlikely that a brief overspeed event would have caused the wear , and without the physical signs of valve-train misalignment , no mechanical reason for the wear can be determined	the excessive wear in the exhaust valve guides for cylinder numbers 3 and 5 remains
cylinder numbers 3 and 5 remains unexplained	The reason for the excessive wear in the exhaust valve guides
the rpm decayed beyond effective cyclic control	he would have lost control of the helicopter
leading to a rapid loss of main rotor rpm	slip
a brief overspeed event	the wear
this amplifying vibration	the two rear vee-belts to come off the sheaves
Such vibration , if it existed , could have exacerbated the vibrations stemming from the cooling fan	the loss of the vee-belts
Such vibration , if it existed ,	the vibrations stemming from the cooling fan
The loss of two vee-belts and the sudden reduction of belt tension	the remaining belts to slip on the driving sheave
The sudden slip would cause a significant loss of power to the transmission system	the rapid decay of main rotor rpm
The sudden slip	a significant loss of power the transmission system
The slippage	the accumulation of rubber on the driving sheave grooves
the pilot	descent into the trees
the damage	the pilot recovering
in turn caused the misalignment of the belts within the sheave grooves	two vee-belts running off the sheaves in flight
in turn	the misalignment of the belts within the sheave grooves
The sudden loss of vee-belt tension caused the remaining two vee-belts on the driving sheave to slip	a rapid loss of main rotor rpm
The sudden loss of vee-belt tension	the remaining two vee-belts on the driving sheave
This , in turn	the pilot avoiding the trees and led to a collision with the terrain and the destruction of the helicopter
