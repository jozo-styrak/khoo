Additionally , the aircraft was modified with a STOL kit that should decrease the risk of a stall	increase the level of safety
the pilot attempted to fly at speeds that were slower than those published in the flight manual	the risk of encountering a stall have increased
such damage occurred in the air , as a precipitating event	the aircraft should have rolled opposite to the direction described
such a system	the pilot would have to rely on more subtle aerodynamic characteristics to warn of an impending stall
occurrence	the

Despite the presence of a tailwind	the aircraft 's speed over the ground

Additionally , the aircraft was modified with a STOL kit	the risk of a stall
the risk of a stall	the level of safety
That will be true	the aircraft is flown in accordance with the published aircraft flight manual procedures
an aggressive application of back pressure on the control column	was large enough to be observed from the ground
Either of these conditions	the risk of an aircraft stall
The aircraft 's heavy weight	the stall speed
A post-crash inspection found no mechanical faults	the aircraft to stall
The pilot , while manoeuvring the aircraft	an aerodynamic stall
The heavy weight of the aircraft	the risk of a stall
The initiation of a low-speed , climbing turn	the risk of a stall
An inoperational stall warning system	the pilot 's ability to recognize the aircraft 's approach to the stall
