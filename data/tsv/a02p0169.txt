events is an engine overspeed and shutdown	However , the white smoke coming from the engine exhaust area after the engine sounds stopped suggests that , although the engines were still turning and fuel was being introduced , the fuel was not being burnt
the investigation determined that the helicopter was within weight and balance limits , had sufficient fuel to conduct the flight weather was not a contributing factor	this analysis focuses on the mechanical issues
cutting	off the fuel to the engine if an overspeed is sensed but do not leave any indication that an overspeed has occurred
The engines are not equipped with auto-relight systems	do not automatically relight after fuel is reintroduced to the engine
an overspeed condition , probably induced during IFWU spit-out	It is concluded that the engines shut down
this defect may have	the IFWU 's ability to maintain engagement
slipping	and spitting out
vibration	However , the quantity of fine bronze particles found would indicate that the oilites were subject to repeated small loads and motion , such as would occur
the loss of rotor rpm , the height available	It is unlikely that the helicopter entered fully-developed autorotative descent
Inspection of the engines did not find any anomalies	the engines
Damage to the oilites	a loss of support the roller retainer
This in turn can cause a loss of alignment of the rollers	the likelihood of roller spit-out
This in turn	a loss of alignment of the rollers , which increases the likelihood of roller spit-out
Contamination of the roller path with oilite material	the likelihood of roller spit-out
A history of accidents shows that when one engine or one IFWU fails on a Sikorsky S-61 , a significant risk exists that the second IFWU will also fail	a dual engine power loss
instability of the rollers and bronze contamination in the roller path	reduced ability of the IFWU
The oilite bushings in the IFWUs deteriorated	instability of the rollers and bronze contamination in the roller path resulting in reduced ability of the IFWU to maintain engagement
Both IFWUs malfunctioned in rapid sequence	the engines to overspeed and subsequently shut down
Following the loss of power of the engines , drive to the main rotor was lost	rotor rpm decay and loss of control of the helicopter
