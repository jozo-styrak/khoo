The incorrect sun gear was inadvertently installed in the helicopter 's transmission over 10 months prior to the occurrence	of this relatively long time period since its installation , individuals directly involved could not recall specific details concerning the ordering , shipping , and installation of the component
why the AME and his supervisor installed the replacement sun gear without first verifying its authenticity could not be determined	In addition , had they verified the part number of the replacement sun gear with the part number of the sun gear removed from the transmission or with the part number contained in the parts catalogue , they would have become aware of a discrepancy and the replacement sun gear would likely not have been installed
of the Engine Out light illumination observed by the pilot during the autorotative descent could not be determined	The pilot 's reaction to the apparent engine malfunction of lowering the collective was the correct response in this situation
this relatively long time period since its installation	individuals directly involved could not recall specific details concerning the ordering , shipping , and installation of the component
doing so	The records clerk could not recall amending the purchase order or the reason
having verified that the sun gear was in fact the correct component	As previously suggested , they may have been misled by the amended part number on the purchase order , or they may have relied on the maintenance personnel at the operator 's base of operations
the ring gear was still being driven by the engine	the hydraulic pump and the main rotor tachometer generator were still being driven
the sudden loss of drive to the main rotor	The unusual sharpness of the left yaw which accompanied the uncoupling of the engine from the main rotor was a result of two factors : 1 -RRB- at the time of the sudden failure , the tail rotor was in a trim position for powered flight and there was suddenly no torque ; and , 2 -RRB- the engine , which was still providing power to the tail rotor , surged
two factors	1 -RRB- at the time of the sudden failure , the tail rotor was in a trim position for powered flight and there was suddenly no torque ; and , 2 -RRB- the engine , which was still providing power to the tail rotor , surged due to the sudden loss of drive to the main rotor and the tail rotor rpm increased momentarily as a direct result of the engine power surge
It was evident ; however , that at some point during the ordering and shipping process , a breakdown in communications occurred	the incorrect component being shipped to the operator
identifiable critical points during the events	the installation of the component by the operator 's maintenance personnel during which the wrong component should have been identified
the main rotor rpm indicator	a momentary indication above 100 % but
The unusual sharpness of the left yaw which accompanied the uncoupling of the engine from the main rotor was a result of two factors : 1 -RRB- at the time of the sudden failure , the tail rotor was in a trim position for powered flight and there was suddenly no torque ; and , 2 -RRB- the engine	power the tail rotor
The sun gear failed	the failure of the main transmission
