the second departure controller cleared the Beech 1900D to climb to 11 000 feet only two miles from the 9000-foot MVA boundary	he expected the aircraft to be able to meet the altitude requirements
The practice of vectoring departures off runway 08 directly toward the high terrain to the north of Vancouver	expedite traffic movements requires that controllers pay careful attention to the climb performance of those aircraft
The POCO ONE SID requires northbound propeller-driven aircraft to turn toward high terrain soon after take-off	expedite other departures
The first departure controller 's experience	him believe that a Beech 1900D on departure from runway 08 right , given a vector of 010 degrees when through 3000 feet , would easily achieve the altitude levels necessary to meet the MVA to the north of Vancouver
The first departure controller 's experience led him to believe that a Beech 1900D on departure from runway 08 right	a vector of 010 degrees
speed	it inside the boundary of the 7000-foot MVA
the first departure controller	a hastily performed transfer of position responsibility briefing which may not have been sufficiently accurate to ensure that the relieving controller was fully aware of the dynamic control situation
The lack of -LRB- or inaccurate -RRB- altitude information on the flight progress strip , together with the Mode C altitude readout showing the aircraft above 8000 feet and the lack of an adequate change of position responsibility briefing	the belief of the second departure controller that the Beech 1900D was established in a climb
aircraft	the altitude requirements
traffic to the south	the controller
The need to control the climb rate of those northbound departures to keep them above the steadily climbing MVA contours , yet below the arrivals on the downwind leg at 10 000 feet	an additional onus
additional distractions during this particularly critical phase of flight	the risk of an ATS incident
Traffic within the south departure sector	both departure controllers from their duty of ensuring terrain clearance for an aircraft on radar vectors in the north departure sector
