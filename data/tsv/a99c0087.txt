Both factors can combine to make take-off impossible , and once a small lake with short take-off runs had been selected for use , the pilot had to consider these two factors in his decision making	, the analysis will deal primarily with pilot decision making and the performance of skis in slush
Only a weight reduction would have accomplished the required increase in performance	, when the pilot arrived at his decision point , the aircraft was not airborne
slushy conditions are the up-slope effect or form drag from the slush build-up in front of the ski and viscous drag from water contact over the entire bottom surface of the ski	wet
decision making	his
he had made decisions that affected the continued operation to the lake	there was a possibility of self-induced pressure to carry out the crew pick-up rather than inconvenience the crew
the aircraft reached this point and was not airborne	the pilot rejected the take-off
he could get the aircraft 's tail up faster , so he moved a passenger from the rear of the cabin to the front to change the centre of gravity and assist in raising the tail	He reasoned that he improve performance
the change in the centre of gravity was questionable ; the penetration of the main skis into the slush remained roughly the same , but this change increased the weight placed	the main skis
the pilot arrived at his decision point	the aircraft was not airborne
the right ski was raised	the pressure on the left ski increased , as demonstrated by the deepening track
