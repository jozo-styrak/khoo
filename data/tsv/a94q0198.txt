of the rapid power decrease could not be determined	In addition , the normal exhaust temperature indicates that power decreased rapidly shortly before impact
of the stall and loss of control at low altitude could not be determined	Although it could not be determined that the fuel was contaminated , the rapidity of the power decrease suggests that it is more likely that a power loss was caused by fuel contamination than by carburettor icing
of the rapid decrease in engine power shortly before the crash could not be determined	The engine was developing little or no power and the propeller was barely turning at the time of the crash
, based on the marks and the tachometer reading near zero , the propeller was barely turning	It is unlikely that the pilot throttled back to idle to reduce impact deceleration forces
fuel system contamination or carburettor icing	However , the decrease in power could have been the result of a power loss
a	power loss due to fuel system contamination or carburettor icing
: 1 - the take-off was executed during the hours of darkness from an unmarked runway	Outside visual references were probably limited
the engine was	little or
engine component failure	no evidence that the decreased power on impact
It is unlikely that the pilot throttled back to idle to reduce impact deceleration forces because	the marks and the tachometer reading near zero
fuel contamination than by carburettor icing	a power loss
Dealing with this problem could have diverted his attention from his primary task of flying the aircraft , or caused spatial disorientation	a stall and loss of control
However	the pilot and passenger 's schedule and the 15 to 20 minutes of preparation normally required
4 - the pitched-up attitude	the view of the ground below and ahead of the aircraft
Lack of external visual references during the initial climb	a stall and loss of control following spatial disorientation
The aircraft was 110 pounds overweight and its centre of gravity was beyond the aft limit	the possibility of a stall
