However , the CJS was not a strong enough signal to alter the controller 's perception that -- based on his observation of the aircraft 's flight path -- it was VFR	, the arrival controller saw no special requirement to closely monitor the Navajo , because he thought there were no conflicts in the aircraft 's path
arriving aircraft , they increase their workload by having to pay extra attention to the aircraft 's flight path until any potential conflict has been satisfactorily resolved	With arrival and departure controllers routinely coordinating altitudes below those specified in the standard operating procedure
none had been mentioned to him by the departure controller	In this occurrence , the arrival controller assumed there was no other traffic of concern to the arriving Navajo ,
the defence provided by the arrival and departure controllers exchanging traffic information	neither controller recognized the impending conflict or the requirement to monitor the traffic more closely in an area in which the normal defences provided by the standard operating procedures were circumvented
looking	at the aircraft 's data tag
he thought there were no conflicts in the aircraft 's path	As a result , the arrival controller saw no special requirement to closely monitor the Navajo ,
not monitoring the aircraft closely on radar , the arrival and departure controllers allowed the two aircraft to fly closer than the minimum required separation of 3 nm laterally or 1000 feet vertically , as specified in CAR 801.08 and the associated standard	A loss of separation occurred when ,
without associated defences being put in place	provide a more expeditious air traffic service
Many procedures also include provision	controllers coordinate out of these procedures to better react to varying circumstances
there is a requirement for increased vigilance and additional safety checks	the level of safety is not compromised
This	an increased workload for the controller

However , the CJS was not a strong enough signal to alter the controller 's perception	his observation of the aircraft 's flight path

Operations Letter OL-97-006	controllers coordinate out of the procedures pertaining to arrival-departure separation without specifying what other specific defences must be in place to provide the appropriate level of safety
