Upon completion of his second approach at Stony Rapids , as he was proceeding toward Fond-du-Lac , the pilot was able to see the runway momentarily	, he decided to turn toward the airport and conduct a visual approach
the time of the occurrence	the centre of gravity was slightly aft of limits
impact damage	The cockpit remote switch was not accessible
its restricted access	In the event that it had not activated on impact , it would have been difficult to manually activate the ELT
GPWS are designed to provide a warning of approach to terrain	enhance safety in high-risk operational environments
persistence to land in Stony Rapids rather than proceed to his selected alternate	his
and the accepted nature of this practice amongst pilots operating in remote communities with non-precision approaches	succeed
he had an early flight the following day	However , the pilot may have chosen to land in Stony Rapids
weighing aircraft loads	No scale was available to the pilot in Edmonton
the cockpit remote switch could not be accessed	Hand tools were required to access the ELT panel ,
Examination of the aircraft did not reveal any mechanical malfunctions	the accident
these factors did	the occurrence , the overweight and aft centre of gravity were a risk to safe operation
During the crash sequence , the anchor points of the cargo net used to secure the baggage failed	baggage
Such a failure	some of the injuries sustained by passengers
the additional loading of the cargo net	the failure of the seat tracks
GPWS and radio altimeters	a defence against controlled flight into terrain accidents
GPWS are designed	a warning of approach terrain
the pilot was	the runway
The trees became his main reference	a lack of awareness of the actual separation between the aircraft and the ground
there was no pressure from management	the pilot to land at the destination airport
there was any form of pressure from management	the pilot to land at the destination airport
Cargo net anchorage system failure	passenger injuries
