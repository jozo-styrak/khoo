ACA 118 requested a climb to FL 410	the Gimli controller forgot the opposite direction traffic , CDN 987 at FL 390 -LRB- lapse of memory -RRB-
a controller must perform both jobs at the same time	the established habit of providing nice-to-have information may be difficult to break
disengagement of attention for relaxation and recovery	there is little or no recovery during a break

The designated stand-back supervisor was working at another sector at the time of the occurrence	, a potential level of defence was not in place
the crew of ACA 118 did not take the action called for in the TCAS RA	they increased and prolonged the requirement for CDN 987 to take evasive action
together with the flight progress strip information available to him	the data necessary to plan , execute , and monitor aircraft separation
An irregular shift rotation had likely disturbed circadian rhythms , and this , together with a regular sleep period of six hours	a sleep debt
The first error	the loss of separation was the clearance for ACA 118 to climb to FL 410
the previous controller	the take-over briefing
he	the same level of service to the aircraft under his control
a pattern known	an elevated on-the-job error rate
The clearance	the conflict , the forgetting of the position of CDN 987 , and the provision of ride information while the conflict was developing are all consistent with fatigue but were not sufficient to prove that the errors were necessarily fatigue induced
The common practice of single-staffing sectors within the Winnipeg specialty of the Winnipeg Area Control Centre	a situation in which the controller was left to control traffic with no ground-based human or electronic back-up

The TCAS fitted in the occurrence aircraft	the conflict alert and resolution solution in the absence of that function by the air traffic service
The circumstances of the Gimli controller 's work-rest cycle	the risk of an occurrence resulting from fatigue-induced errors
The passing of lower-priority ride reports	the controller from higher - priority separation tasks , such as radar monitoring during the climb of ACA 118
Strong habit intrusion , possibly facilitated by fatigue	him to pass these reports of light turbulence which were not safety-imperative
they increased	the requirement for CDN 987
