controller was monitoring five aircraft at the time , none of which could be viewed as being of much lower priority	Monitoring by air traffic controllers provides another level of defence against incursions
Whether configured for good or poor visibility , the RIMCAS warning comes only after an incursion has taken place	, as presently configured , RIMCAS can only assist in mitigating the consequences by defending against the collision that might follow
Both crew members of Learjet N70AX were unfamiliar with the Toronto / Lester B. Pearson International Airport and did not correctly perceive their position on the field	, they did not hold short of the runway as instructed by air traffic control -LRB- ATC -RRB- and unintentionally proceeded onto the runway into the path of a landing aeroplane
the crew would be at the limit of their crew day by the time they reached home base -RRB-	the incursion occurred while taxiing out ; only one crew member was monitoring the taxi route and compliance with the instruction ; distraction by the before-take-off checklists ; night lighting conditions ; fatigue associated with the third leg of the day at the 12-hour point of the crew duty day ; and operational pressure -LRB- self-imposed
these would overcome the pilot 's misconception of his position	Additional indications of the holding point , such as illuminated stop bars or enhanced taxiway markings system , be provided ; however , it is uncertain
this measure is intended to avoid coordination errors between controllers	It is also inconclusive whether putting the taxiing aeroplane on the same frequency as aircraft landing and taking off would have had an effect
When the incursion took place , the controller had looked back towards N70AX , but the impending incursion was not obvious due to relative movement being directly towards the tower	not easily discernable to the human eye , especially at night
relative movement being directly towards the tower and therefore not easily discernable to the human eye , especially at night	When the incursion took place , the controller had looked back towards N70AX , but the impending incursion was not obvious
the incursion took place	the controller had looked back towards N70AX
The aural warning provided insufficient time for controllers to instruct either aircraft	would not have averted a potential collision
defending	against the collision that might follow
them to take action	Averting a collision after a RIMCAS warning is highly reliant on the controller providing appropriate instructions to the flight crews in time
the potential for catastrophic consequences in the event of a collision at high speed	The residual risk remains high
he was carrying out checks while the pilot-in-command -LRB- PIC -RRB- taxied the aircraft	The co-pilot did not assist in monitoring the taxi route or compliance with instructions
their attention	their perception they were proceeding correctly
Potential factors	their reduced level of awareness are familiar from previous studies
their	level of awareness
these	the pilot 's misconception of his position
it would depend on the timing of clearances and frequency changes	other risks
Monitoring by air traffic controllers	another level of defence against incursions
Four of these aircraft were to the east side of the field ; only N70AX was northwest of the tower	the controller having to scan a large arc
The RIMCAS system is intended	an additional level of defence
The aural warning	insufficient time controllers
RIMCAS	a warning
on the controller	appropriate instructions to the flight crews in time them to take action
the aircraft reaches a holding point	the controller to intervene and prevent an incursion
the passive measures intended	pilot deviations
the passive measures intended to reduce pilot deviations related to entering runways at taxiway hold points	the likelihood of these types of incursion
operational pressures	alertness
The runway incursion and monitoring and conflict alerting system -LRB- RIMCAS -RRB- does not provide sufficient time to prevent incursions , nor does it provide sufficient warning	air traffic controllers avert a collision
sufficient time	incursions
it	sufficient warning
