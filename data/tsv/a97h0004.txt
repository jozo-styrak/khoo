Moreover , the T-33 was not equipped with TCAS equipment which could have alerted the pilot of an aircraft approaching on a collision course	, the pilot was required to scan his entire visual field rather than concentrate his scan in the direction of the approaching Jetstream
this concentration of civilian aviation traffic along this corridor	the use of IP Delta as a holding point for the T-33 military aircraft exposed military aircraft holding in this corridor to an increased potential for a mid-air or near mid-air collision with the civilian traffic
first advised of the T-33 's presence	the Jetstream crew were overtaking the T-33 and were above and six miles behind it
its collision trajectory	When advised that the T-33 was at five miles and had turned toward them , still below their altitude , the Jetstream crew 's problem in detecting the T-33 was further compounded by a reduction in its profile which was now being viewed head-on and by the target now remaining more or less stationary in their field of view
commencing	a shallow descent toward the target
the crew focusing their attention toward locating the target	This descent was not initiated consciously and was likely
the T-33 pilot entered his turn to the south-east , in a direction directly toward the Jetstream	the aircraft were approximately five miles apart
that distance	the Jetstream would have presented a relatively small visual target
The informal practice of IFR traffic using the river as a visual , around the camp route	the volume of traffic over and near IP Delta
the crew	the situation by commencing a shallow descent toward the target
The pilot , therefore	any ATC agency of his intentions
The relatively small profiles of both aircraft when viewed head on	it difficult for the crews involved to visually detect either aircraft
The high closure rate	little time the crews
