the previous flight crew ensured that the trim tab was centred and it was not used during the flight	it can be concluded that it was centred when the aircraft arrived at Montr al
the tendency to roll left occurred	the crew should have noticed the inconsistency between the position of the indicator and the tendency to roll
the crew received the first instruction to not continue the approach	they were in full control of the aircraft
supervisor	to that of flight dispatcher unbeknownst to the actual flight dispatcher
the aileron trim tab	the tendency to roll encountered on departure from Montr al
However , incorrect adjustment of the trim tab during previous maintenance may have contributed to an incorrect indication in the cockpit	the pilots believe that the trim tab was correctly aligned when it was in fact deflected five degrees upward
The arrangement of the logbook given to the captain -LRB- that is , the fact that there were two Part 2s -RRB-	it less clear that there was an entry stating that the indicator was defective
a runaway trim tab to the right	a tendency to roll left
A placard	that inconsistency
the loss of a panel	resistance
The indication of maximum trim tab deflection	the captain to believe that resistance was created by the loss of a panel
the defective indicator	and on the false indication
This conclusion was	the absence of the severe vibrations that had been reported to him
the presence of a placard	the pilots take into account the indicator in their analysis of the observed anomaly
Other elements	them realize that the trim tab was not fully deflected as they believed it to be
the position of the ball on the turn indicator	them understand more clearly what was happening
In such a case , they could have passed this information on to the pilots and the director of flight operations	them make a more accurate assessment of the situation
them	a more accurate assessment of the situation
But the situation still seemed abnormal	them uncomfortable with the idea of executing a missed approach
the presence of people in his office	his actions
the decision-making process	the missed approach
This would have avoided the confusion	surrounding the telephone calls with the control tower
This confusion	a delay in the last transmission of the instruction to the pilots to execute a missed approach , which placed the crew in a precarious situation , that is , a missed approach at low altitude
This confusion contributed to a delay in the last transmission of the instruction to the pilots to execute a missed approach	the crew in a precarious situation , that is ,
The decision to order a missed approach	more time management personnel
radar	precision in the aircraft position
The aileron trim tab was improperly aligned	the tendency of the aircraft to roll on departure from Montr al
The absence of a placard near the indicator and the arrangement of information in the logbook	the crew being unaware of the defective aileron trim tab indicator
Poor task distribution between the assistant chief dispatcher and the flight dispatcher created confusion in the telephone conversations with the tower controller , which delayed transmission of the second order to execute a missed approach	a missed approach at very low altitude
Poor task distribution between the assistant chief dispatcher and the flight dispatcher	confusion in the telephone conversations with the tower controller , which delayed transmission of the second order to execute a missed approach , resulting in a missed approach at very low altitude
the flight dispatcher created confusion in the telephone conversations with the tower controller	transmission of the second order
