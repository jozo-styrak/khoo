The engine was likely operating normally ; however , its horsepower would have decreased about 23 per cent in the conditions present during the accident flight	of the relatively high density altitude would be felt in all facets of the aeroplane 's performance
The aircraft was close to its maximum gross take-off weight and had degraded performance because of the relatively high density altitude	, the angle of climb was too shallow to clear the trees at the end the airstrip
the	relatively high density altitude would be felt in all facets of the aeroplane 's performance
the extra weight on the accident flight	these conditions contributed to the aircraft not attaining an angle of climb sufficient to clear the trees to the north of the airstrip
the aeroplane did not reach a height sufficient to fly over the trees	the pilot probably banked the aeroplane to avoid the trees

its horsepower	about 23 per cent in the conditions present during the accident flight
the high density altitude and wind conditions	the flight
even the slightest tail wind from the south	the distance required to clear the trees at the end of the field
these conditions	the aircraft not attaining an angle of climb sufficient to clear the trees to the north of the airstrip
an angle of climb	the trees to the north of the airstrip
This manoeuvring would have affected the airflow over the wings	the aeroplane to stall at a height from which a recovery was not possible
This manoeuvring	the airflow over the wings
The pilot 's attempt to manoeuvre to avoid the trees	a stall at an altitude that was too low for the pilot to recover
