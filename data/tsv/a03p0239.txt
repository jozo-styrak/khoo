two hours	The aircraft had started with full tanks and had only flown
a technical malfunction is also unlikely	Fuel starvation
an engine requires an appropriate fuel/air mixture to be supplied to the cylinders	operate
fuel was confirmed to be available at the fuel distributor	which is immediately in line and upstream of the fuel nozzles , it is unlikely that fuel starvation was the cause of the loss of engine performance
a number of the fuel components had been damaged in the crash and , subsequently , because some lines had to be disconnected to allow removal and transport of the wreckage to an examination facility , it is likely that one or more of these breaches of the fuel system could have allowed fuel to escape from various locations within the system	Specifically ,
one or more of these breaches of the fuel system	fuel escape from various locations within the system
The deteriorated condition of the o-ring installed in the left-tank supply port	the fuel selector operating normally , such that it could allow fuel to be supplied to the engine when the selector was in the OFF position
