His subsequent turn to the left is consistent with an attempt to fly away from the potential collision and may indicate that the pilot was uncertain that a safe contract was being flown	of
the Waco turned between the Wolf-Samson and the spectators	The Dairy Turn , as originally conceived and flown , had not caused problems when the Waco was too far behind the Pitts
the tracks intersected at 90 , with the potential for both aircraft to be banked away from the other	The first point of possible collision was more dangerous
the manoeuvre 's timing	it was critical for either pilot to obtain visual contact with the other pilot
the increased risk	the two pilots should have ensured that a clearly understood contract was in place
he did not have visual contact with the Waco , that there was an imminent risk of collision	The climb was consistent with the pilot concluding that the Waco was late and ,
the Wolf-Samson pilot 's contract was to maintain separation	his action have established an altitude separation between the two aircraft
the Waco pilot 's contract was to maintain separation	his action have established an altitude separation between the two aircraft
This	flight paths that did not cross and gave the pilot of the Waco visual contact with the Wolf-Samson or its smoke during the second 90 turn
this variation of the manoeuvre	the crowd the illusion of danger
The modified Dairy Turn , however	flight paths that crossed twice resulting in two points of possible collision -LRB- see Figure 3 -RRB-
means	safe separation
the lateness of his turn toward the Wolf-Samson	an imminent risk of collision
The wind blew the smoke from the display away from the performers	them a clear view of the display airspace
The wind would have blown the Wolf-Samson during his turn toward the 1500-foot show line	the pilot
The wind would have blown the Wolf-Samson during his turn toward the 1500-foot show line and may have resulted in the pilot holding his bank angle longer than normal	the period of time he
The immediate public address announcements by the air show commentator likely kept spectators from moving toward the crash site	public safety after the accident
the Dairy Turn	such a vector
The limited information	the other manoeuvres in the sequential list
This modification	timing critical
