g was established at the gross weight of the original design , the limit load factor would be reduced to 3.4 g when the aircraft was flown at a higher weight	3.8
the time of the accident	the aircraft was approximately 200 pounds below its maximum allowable gross weight
The limit load factor decreases faster than the gust-imposed load factor when weight is increased	, heavily loaded aircraft can be damaged without particularly high g loadings
the structure had been weakened by previously exceeding the aircraft limit load factor	A large movement of the flight controls at the maximum design cruising speed , in itself , cause structural damage , especially
If the gust rolled the aircraft significantly from level flight and the pilot tried to correct the roll with a large aileron control input , the average g loading might not have been critical , but the downgoing wing would have had a higher angle of attack	sustained a higher load factor
a wing is close to its limit load factor when torsional forces are introduced	the forces be sufficient to cause structural failure
a lack of readily available reference information	The ailerons were not properly maintained , balanced or rigged
the layout of the airspeed indicator	it difficult to interpret airspeed readings in mph on the smaller inner scale , since it would have been easier and more natural to refer to the larger outer scale
a pilot report of such activity in the area 1 hours before the accident	it highly probable
Weight	the limit load factor
A large movement of the flight controls at the maximum design cruising speed could , in itself	structural damage
The aircraft likely encountered a strong gust	the slats to deploy asymmetrically and then to be torn off the wing structure
This likely caused wing torsional oscillations	the flaps separating
This	wing torsional oscillations which may have resulted in the flaps separating
The gust , which may have exceeded the aircraft 's limit load factor , might also have exceeded the aircraft 's ultimate load factor	the right wing main spar
the forces	structural failure
As indicated by the fretting corrosion on the lower wing attachment points , the aircraft had previously exceeded its limit load factor	the ultimate load factor
A strong gust likely exceeded the aircraft 's ultimate load factor in cruise	the right wing main spar
The ailerons were not properly maintained , balanced or rigged due to a lack of readily available reference information	the aircraft 's airworthiness
