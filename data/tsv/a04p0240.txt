The size , slope , construction , and orientation of the landing pad did not permit the accident helicopter to return and land successfully following the rotor rpm decay and the resulting uncommanded descent	, once the helicopter began its vertical , climbing turn from the hover , and the full power condition was reached , it was impossible to successfully land on the sloping pad
The helicopter climbed vertically out of the hover at near-maximum gross weight , it encountered down-flowing air , which resulted in a situation in which there was insufficient power to maintain controlled flight	, the rotor rpm decayed rapidly , and the helicopter descended in an overpitched condition until it struck the terrain
the down-flowing air in the area , the pilot may have unwittingly applied more collective pitch than he had intended to maintain his turning hover-climb , thus precipitating the rapid rotor rpm decay	In this accident ,
the helicopter encountered down-flowing air	this rate would have been reduced proportionately until neutralized by a wind of 820 feet per minute or in the order of eight knots
considering the adverse surface conditions beneath the helicopter	recover
No mechanical conditions were identified	this accident , therefore , this analysis focuses upon the operational factors surrounding the flight
the topography and location are	the formation of down-flowing winds , the velocity of which can change quickly
Unpredictable down flows are challenging for a helicopter pilot	uncommanded descent from which the helicopter may not have sufficient power to recover
To counter this increased rotation , the pilot would have had to apply right pedal	the engine power available to the main rotor system
Winds of at least such strength were reported at the accident site , and it is likely that the vertical performance was eroded by the down-flow wind	the helicopter climbing as required
The pilot turned left during the climbing take-off	the transmission torque assist the turn , thereby delaying the power demand by the tail rotor
the transmission torque to assist the turn	the power demand by the tail rotor
insufficient power	or
A demand for more power than available , in combination with the high collective pitch	rotor rpm decay and a descent with the rotor system in an overpitched condition
the right turn	the tail rotor power demand and
In contrast , had the pilot turned right and then reached the same maximum power situation	or
the tail rotor power demand	it available to the main rotor
The helicopter climbed vertically out of the hover at near-maximum gross weight , it encountered down-flowing air	a situation in which there was insufficient power to maintain controlled flight
