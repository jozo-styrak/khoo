There were no anomalies found with the helicopter that would have contributed to the accident	, this analysis focuses on the operation of the helicopter
several factors	The lap belt barrel nut attachment failed
wear from the stainless steel lap belt attachment	First , the barrel nut was weakened
the main load would be over the machined groove and seat-back attachment bolts	Under normal loads , such as forward and aft g-forces , this would not be an issue
There were no anomalies found with the helicopter	the accident
The mature trees along the flight path	the obstacle height
the steep approach angle of 8 into the landing site	adequate clearance above the trees
This	an additional cue to the flight crew the helicopter was approaching the ground too soon during the descent into the helipad
This	the pilots the task at hand
In this case , the PF acknowledged a 0.5 nm and 500 foot call , an on-profile condition , but visually perceived that the helicopter was too high and , therefore	the rate of descent
This coincides with the increase in the rotor rpm ; an indication that the collective is being lowered	the load on the rotor blades
the load on the rotor blades	the descent rate
This was followed by a decrease in rotor rpm , as the collective was raised	the load on the rotor blades
the load on the rotor blades	the descent rate
he	any further speed or altitude calls after the deviation
The increased descent rate	the helicopter to descend into the trees before either crew member realized what was happening
This	a weak point on the assembly at the outside edge of the barrel nut
This	an abnormal load
This placed an abnormal load on the end of the barrel nut	it to fail at the weakest point
visual spatial disorientation	flying -LRB- PF -RRB-
The right rear aft-facing paramedic seat lap belt attachment barrel nut was worn in the groove where the seat belt attaches	the barrel nut 's structural integrity
the seat belt attaches , weakening the barrel nut 's structural integrity	the risk of failure
The helicopter crashed on its side	an abnormal side load
an abnormal side load on the right rear aft facing paramedic seat lap belt attachment barrel nut	it to fail
