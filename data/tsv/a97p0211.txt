the pilot had called the Fire Centre seven minutes before the occurrence and gave no indication that there was any problem with the flight or the aircraft , it is unlikely that mechanical defect contributed to this accident	As well ,
the high outside air temperature and the high operating altitude above sea level , the aircraft performance was reduced , such that the available rate-of-climb was only sufficient to keep the aircraft at a near-constant height above the rising valley floor	Furthermore ,
The combination of the flight path angle , reported by witnesses as being parallel to the rising valley floor	angle is characteristic of an aircraft that has stalled and struck the ground
the aircraft entered the steep turn reported by the witnesses	the aircraft 's stall speed would have increased
When the pilot entered a steep left turn to avoid the rising terrain , the stall speed increased	, the aircraft stalled
the pilot entered a steep left turn to avoid the rising terrain	the stall speed increased
the aircraft stalled	its height above the ground was insufficient for the pilot to recover from the stall
mechanical defect	this accident
the pilot had called the Fire Centre seven minutes before the occurrence	no indication there was any problem with the flight or the aircraft
In any event , the pilot flew up a valley	him the illusion of there being a suitable exit route
such that the available rate-of-climb	the aircraft at a near-constant height above the rising valley floor
The valley and surrounding terrain	an illusion a suitable exit route existed at the end of the valley
The combination of high air temperature and altitude	aircraft climb
