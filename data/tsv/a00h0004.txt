the correct threshold crossing height and speed	the aircraft could easily have been stopped on the wet runway
applying the spoilers	but when the configuration warning horn sounded , he retracted the spoilers
the higher-than-normal landing speed	the aircraft would float for considerable distance
informing the flight crew of the new weather , was not aware that new weather had been issued	The tower controller , who was responsible
The tower controller did not have that information to pass on to the ERS personnel , potentially delaying or slowing ERS operations	jeopardizing ERS and passenger safety
The manner in which the descent and the approach were conducted	the approach being unstable
The unstable approach	the aircraft
The aircraft 's excessive altitude and speed over the threshold , combined with the lack of a more aggressive landing technique	the long landing and the high touchdown speed
The long landing and the high touchdown speed , combined with the lack of immediate and sustained aggressive application of braking and reverse thrust	the overrun
The captain attempted	the aircraft by applying the spoilers
flare	a smooth landing
the controller was	it
The change in the weather	this occurrence
