The helicopter was well below maximum certificated gross weight and the longitudinal CG was near the aft limit	of the relative light weight of the helicopter , a lesser amount of collective pitch application would have been necessary for the helicopter to become airborne
The hydraulic servo actuator has a time between overhaul -LRB- TBO -RRB- of either 1800 or 3000 hours in service and is therefore subject to periodic overhaul and specification adjustment , whereas the accumulator unit is an on-condition item and is not subject to overhaul	, an accumulator with undetected marginal performance could remain on an airframe for an indefinite period
the collective lock in place	it is clear that the helicopter flight controls behaved in a predictable manner
the lateral accumulator -LRB- s -RRB- exhausting and causing the flight controls to move to the non-hydraulic-powered position	Once the pilot continued testing , it was only a matter of time before the collective stick rose up
the relative light weight of the helicopter	a lesser amount of collective pitch application would have been necessary for the helicopter to become airborne
The aft CG condition would have required the pilot to maintain more forward cyclic input in flight than normal	reduced the available forward cyclic stick travel
circumstances leading to the accident was the procedural requirement to establish full flying rotor rpm -LRB- revolutions per minute -RRB- for the pre-flight hydraulic test procedure	the
the servos always leave the overhaul/manufacturing facility well within the required specification tolerances	it is clear that , in some cases , a servo can deteriorate in service
function of the flight control system in flight	the proper
the pilot interrupted his pre-flight hydraulic test sequence	the collective stick lock released without his knowledge
the lateral accumulator -LRB- s -RRB- exhausted	the unlocked collective stick rose up sharply and caused the helicopter to become airborne
in-service monitoring is not done , nor is it required by regulation	There is no meaningful data concerning the effect of in-flight conditions upon the specification performance of the hydraulic servo actuators
the pilot was	the helicopter from becoming airborne
pre-flight procedures are in place	it
This analysis will therefore focus on the reasons behind the chain of events	the collective move and cause the accident
Also , several physical and procedural anomalies were discovered that had an impact on the safety defences that are built into the flight control system and its operation , including those	TSB safety action
This	a situation
centralized the flight controls	the AME under the rotor disk
Such pressure was	the improperly engaged lock
accumulator -LRB- s -RRB- exhausting	the flight
The aft CG condition would have required the pilot to maintain more forward cyclic input in flight than normal	the available forward cyclic stick travel
ability	the nose of the helicopter rapidly rising
this reduction in forward cyclic stick travel	the helicopter vulnerable to nose-high attitudes
inconsistent interpretation of the procedures promulgated in the RFM	doubt
this subjective factor	the recharging element of the pre-flight test an insensitive method of assessing the integrity of the accumulator
Another factor in the circumstances	the accident was the procedural requirement to establish full flying rotor rpm -LRB- revolutions per minute -RRB- for the pre-flight hydraulic test procedure
the flying rotor rpm	the helicopter in a condition to certainly become airborne
the inconsistent servo travel rates	the accident , there is doubt that such servo behaviour is always benign
It is possible that a combination of servo performance tolerance limits , though individually insignificant , could act synergistically in a manner	the servo malfunction
that asymmetric lateral servo accumulator depletion	uncommanded servo movement
These modifications	pilots shut off the hydraulic system pressure and exhaust the accumulators simultaneously , thus providing a controlled transition into non-hydraulic-assisted flight
These modifications allowed pilots to shut off the hydraulic system pressure and exhaust the accumulators simultaneously	a controlled transition into non-hydraulic-assisted flight
the pilot be	to manipulate the flight controls with reasonable feedback forces in the event of a hydraulic system failure
The hydraulic accumulators are the sole approved mechanical devices	that guarantee
There is still the risk that flight in the AS 350 helicopter could commence with one or more marginally serviceable hydraulic accumulators	the level of defence against hydraulic system failure
The design of the lock button on the collective stick allowed improper engagement with the locking plate	premature release of the collective stick during the hydraulic test procedure
The design of the lock button on the collective stick	improper engagement with the locking plate
the unlocked collective stick rose up sharply	the helicopter
the collective stick	the helicopter becoming airborne , nor could control of the helicopter be regained before it struck the ground
the pilot was	the collective stick
this situation	the nose-up attitude
such rpm	the helicopter to become airborne inadvertently
the condition of significant pressure differential in the main rotor accumulators	unequal depletion of the reserve of pressurized hydraulic fluid , thereby causing asymmetric servo actuator movement , high and unpredictable flight control forces , and a potential loss of control in flight
In the event of a hydraulic system pressure loss in the AS 350 B2 helicopter , the condition of significant pressure differential in the main rotor accumulators leads to unequal depletion of the reserve of pressurized hydraulic fluid	asymmetric servo actuator movement , high and unpredictable flight control forces , and a potential loss of control in flight
The risk is that flight in the AS 350 helicopter could commence with one or more marginally serviceable hydraulic accumulators	the level of defence against subsequent hydraulic system failure
An earlier airworthiness directive from Transport Canada required the cyclic to be moved to exhaustion	a more meaningful assessment of accumulator condition
the exhaustion of the hydraulic accumulators	movement
Functional tests with the servo actuators	inconsistent travel rates were beyond the manufacturers ' specifications
