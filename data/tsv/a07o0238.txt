Mounting the emergency locator transmitter -LRB- ELT -RRB- in the area of the lower nose window made it vulnerable to impact damage	, the ELT became detached and was separated from its external antenna during the impact sequence , increasing the risk of the ELT signal not being detected
the malfunction of the directional gyro , the pilot referenced the GPS for primary heading information	In addition ,
it was dark and the pilot did not have a night rating or any experience flying at night	Returning to a previous location along the route of flight was likely discounted
Furthermore , the destination coordinates were not used for the time of sunset calculations	a 22-minute error
This	an arrival in the Cochrane area after sunset
This most likely	the proper scan of the primary flight instruments
These two factors	the pilot 's difficulty in flying the aircraft with reference to instruments only
The above-mentioned instrument training is deemed sufficient	non-instrument-rated pilots maintain control of the aircraft in case of inadvertent flight into instrument meteorological conditions -LRB- IMC -RRB-
The flight was continued at night in deteriorating weather conditions resulting in the pilot losing visual reference with the ground and becoming disoriented	the aircraft being flown into the ground
conditions	the pilot losing visual reference with the ground
without the latest available weather	the possibility of inadvertent flight into inclement weather
the emergency locator transmitter -LRB- ELT -RRB- in the area of the lower nose window	it vulnerable to impact damage
As a result , the ELT became detached and was separated from its external antenna during the impact sequence	the risk of the ELT signal
