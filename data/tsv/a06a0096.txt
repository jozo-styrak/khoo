During the initial performance calculation , an error in the weight of fuel on board -LRB- FOB -RRB- for take-off was introduced	, the performance data generated was not correct
SOPs must be effective in circumstances where the crew is working under pressure , interrupted or distracted , facing non-standard situations , and in periods of high workload	, there must be human performance considerations during the design , development , and use of these critical defences
Although the SOPs required that the crew transcribe the EFB performance generated data to the operational flight plan , there was no specific location on the operational flight plan to transcribe the take-off performance figures	, the crew wrote them down on the top right corner of the page
a combination of the crew deviating from SOPs and the operational flight plan form design that prevented easy identification of discrepancies	In this occurrence , the crew took off using incorrect take-off performance references
both pilots deviated from SOPs and the PF calculated the take-off data	However , on this day , this was not done
the verification of the preliminary performance calculations been accomplished correctly	the discrepancy
the planned figures were located in the opposite corner	at the bottom left of that same page , it was difficult to compare the calculated performance figures and the planned figures
generating the performance figures would have been easier to identify	Had there been a specific area , adjacent to the planned figures , to transcribe the calculated performance data , the discrepancy between the planned take-off weight and the take-off weight used
there been a specific area , adjacent to the planned figures , to transcribe the calculated performance data	the discrepancy between the planned take-off weight and the take-off weight used for generating the performance figures would have been easier to identify
transcribing calculated performance data	There is no area on the operational flight plan
The analysis will therefore focus on the safety defences	the crew from attempting to take off using incorrect take-off performance references
This	the use of a lower-than-required thrust setting for take-off , V speeds that were inappropriate for the weight of the aircraft , and less-than-optimum performance and handling characteristics
the situation	an increased workload
This was a result of a combination of the crew deviating from SOPs and the operational flight plan form design	easy identification of discrepancies
this	substantial aircraft damage and loss of life
This	easy identification of the take-off weight discrepancy
A take-off performance monitoring system	the crew an accurate and timely indication of inadequate take-off performance
