the shortened runway	The pilot extended ten degrees of flaps for take-off , probably in order to shorten the take-off roll
the nose-high attitude , low airspeed , and engine power	Either the pilot began a left turn , or the aircraft yawed to the left
disrupted engine valve operation	The aircraft engine could not develop maximum rated power
assembly needle bearings in the starter drive unit which was removed on 21 June 1996 failed prior to the unit 's removal	to occur between the drive clutch gear and the stub shaft
The wear metal contaminated the engine oil system	four of the eight engine hydraulic valve lifters jam
valve operation	the power output of the engine
The disrupted valve action	a rough running engine
The engine was developing sufficient power for the aircraft to become airborne and climb slowly ; however , once airborne , the pilot maintained a nose-high attitude	the aircraft accelerating to a safe indicated climb airspeed
The induced yaw	the aircraft to roll -LRB- bank -RRB- left
The application of aileron control input at the point of stall	the aircraft 's tendency
The needle bearings in the starter drive gear assembly which was removed on 21 June 1996 failed prior to the assembly 's removal	contamination of the engine lubricating oil with wear metal
The pilot maintained an aircraft nose-high attitude after take-off	the aircraft accelerating to a safe climb airspeed
No discrepancies	the accident were noted with the airframe , airframe systems , or propeller
