When the cylinder head failed , the resultant flame/gas path was above and away from the area of the engine that is sensed by the fire warning system	, the fire warning light did not activate
the cylinder head failed	the resultant flame/gas path was above and away from the area of the engine that is sensed by the fire warning system
the effects of exhaust gases leaking at the exhaust port and heating the exhaust ear of the cylinder	Failure of the No. 2 exhaust valve guide and subsequent failure of the exhaust valve likely occurred
flaming fuel-air mixture escaped from the cylinder through the continuously open exhaust port and joined with the exhaust from the No. 3 cylinder	operate
This failure	combustible fuel-air mixture
The abnormally high temperatures that developed inside the augmentor tube were	carbon and oil deposits , normally found in the tube , to be burned away
These combined exhaust gases	a high heat burned away carbon and oil residues normally found in the upper right
Failure of the valve in the No. 2 cylinder	failure of the cylinder head and development of a gas/fire path across the top of the engine to the firewall and down towards the upper right augmentor
The pilot was	the fire using the on-board hand-held fire extinguisher
