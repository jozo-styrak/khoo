The autofeather system does not incorporate a delay between the time a low propeller thrust condition is detected and the time the autofeather occurs	, with the propellers in a low-thrust condition , parameters were met for an autofeather and engine shutdown when the first officer rapidly advanced the power levers beyond the 60 position
Several abnormal events occurred in rapid succession during the last seven seconds of the final approach	, the captain was unaware of the cause of the high sink rate , and when he made the decision to go around , he was not aware that the left engine had shut down
Attempting a go-around at a point where the crew had intended to land , deviating from the go-around SOP , and the captain 's retarding the power levers all contributed to the crew losing situational awareness	was confusion in the cockpit and a breakdown of crew coordination , which impeded the crew 's ability to recognize and deal with the engine autofeather and shutdown
However , inconsistencies between different sections of the AOMs , the lack of a checklist for training in the circuit , and the absence of information on rejected landings likely contributed to the confusion that the crew experienced , which affected the decision to initiate a go-around	marks on the right engine 's coordinator cam indicate that the captain had reduced the right power lever to approximately the 60 position , where it likely remained until impact
The first officer did not provide engine power status to the captain	, the captain was not aware that the remaining -LRB- right -RRB- engine was not set to deliver maximum power
deviating from the go-around SOP	land
the airspeed and landing weight at which the aircraft touched down	there was more than sufficient distance remaining to stop under normal conditions
The aircraft 's TD system provides engine over-temperature protection	, there was no immediate requirement for the captain to retard the power levers
the flaps were not retracted to 15 upon initiation of the go-around	the aircraft did not accelerate and climb as it was capable of doing
the flaps were retracted	the aircraft was in a left bank flight attitude
normal power on the remaining right engine	it would have been impossible for the aircraft to accelerate to an airspeed at which the aircraft was controllable
The resulting increased drag combined with the low power setting likely	the rapid rate of descent
An inadvertent engine shutdown can normally be handled without losing control of the aircraft	the performance capabilities of the aircraft and crew training for such emergencies
he	the decision to go around
all	the crew losing situational awareness
inconsistencies between different sections of the AOMs , the lack of a checklist for training in the circuit , and the absence of information on rejected landings	the confusion that the crew experienced , which affected the decision to initiate a go-around
However , inconsistencies between different sections of the AOMs , the lack of a checklist for training in the circuit , and the absence of information on rejected landings likely contributed to the confusion that the crew experienced	the decision to initiate a go-around
the captain had	the right power lever approximately the 60 position , where it likely remained until impact
The aircraft 's TD system	engine over-temperature protection
power on the operating engine decreased the aircraft 's energy status	its inability to accelerate to an airspeed at which control could have been maintained
power on the operating engine	the aircraft 's energy status
The erratic power lever movement increased the risk of an undesired activation of the right engine 's NTS system , which may have produced an engine underspeed	available power
The erratic power lever movement	the risk of an undesired activation of the right engine 's NTS system , which may have produced an engine underspeed , reducing available power , and possibly causing the right engine to flame out
the risk of an undesired activation of the right engine 's NTS system	an engine underspeed , reducing available power , and possibly causing the right engine to flame out
available power	the right engine
The aircraft 's low-energy state	its inability to accelerate to the airspeed required to accomplish a successful go-around procedure
the aircraft 's low-energy status	the eventual loss of control
The rapid power lever advancement caused an inadvertent shutdown of the left engine	the aircraft 's low-energy status
The rapid power lever advancement	an inadvertent shutdown of the left engine , which exacerbated the aircraft 's low-energy status and contributed to the eventual loss of control
The inadvertent activation of the autofeather system	the crew 's loss of situational awareness , which adversely influenced the decision to go around , at a time when it may have been possible for the aircraft to safely stop and remain on the runway
The inadvertent activation of the autofeather system contributed to the crew 's loss of situational awareness	the decision to go around
The shortage and ambiguity of information available on rejected landings contributed to confusion between the pilots	a delayed retraction of the flaps
The shortage and ambiguity of information available on rejected landings	confusion between the pilots , which resulted in a delayed retraction of the flaps
This departure from procedure	the aircraft accelerating adequately
setting	an inadequate power setting on the right engine
setting resulted in an inadequate power setting on the right engine	a breakdown of crew coordination
This	the crew effectively identifying and responding to the emergencies
Rapid power movement	the risk of inadvertent activation of the negative torque sensing system during critical flight regimes
These inconsistencies	confusion between the training captain and the operator 's pilots
The lack of such checklist information	pilot workload
