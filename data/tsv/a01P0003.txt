rate of climb when total power loss	The spiral bevel pinion and the main spiral bevel gears demonstrated wear patterns consistent with improper alignment
In addition , there was a difference of 0.029 inch in the measurements of surfaces between the No. 4 bearing inner race and the fixture at the time of overhaul build-up	concluded that these gears were misaligned during the build-up at the time of the last main-rotor transmission overhaul
The only anomalies identified during the teardown that could cause such vibrations were the misalignment and subsequent movement of the Nos. 3 and 4 bearings , the spiral bevel pinion , and the main spiral bevel gears	likely that vibrations and high forces initiated movement of the misaligned components and that movement caused the backlash to be extremely out of its specifications
the roller retainer rests on the Oilite bushings	This created instability of the rollers
the other IFWU was also worn and contaminated	it failed within a very short time of the initial IFWU failure
the load of driving the main rotor was lost	the engines oversped and shut down
impact forces exceeded the design criteria of the seat	The seat and restraint system of the pilot not flying broke free from its mountings , likely
neither engine was able to produce the maximum 123 per cent torque for the IFWUs	it was not likely that overtorques/loading of the IFWUs caused a failure
it was manufactured with large pores and incomplete sintering	An Oilite bushing broke down
the roller retainer rests on the Oilite bushings	This created instability of the rollers
the first IFWU disengaged	all power demanded by the rotor system was transmitted to the remaining IFWU , which was worn and contaminated , causing it to fail within a very short time of the first failure
This	instability of the rollers
The instability	pinch
The instability , increased pinch angle of the rollers and cams -LRB- caused by dents in the cams -RRB- , and bronze contamination	the rollers
-LRB- When one IFWU disengages , all power demanded by the rotor system is transmitted to the remaining IFWU	the likelihood the remaining IFWU will quickly fail
Loss of drive from both engines , while a helicopter is climbing at a high rate -LRB- high pitch angle on the blades -RRB-	rapid rotor rpm decay
This would have substantial effect on gear operation	torsional oscillations or torsional vibrations
The only anomalies identified during the teardown	such vibrations
movement	the backlash to be extremely out of its specifications
This	vibrations and movement of the casting
the spiral bevel pinion and the main spiral bevel gears had	wear on every fifth tooth
no indications of vibrations	the IFWUs during the first 500 hours
overtorques/loading of the IFWUs	a failure
neither engine was	the maximum 123 per cent torque for the IFWUs
This	instability of the rollers
The instability	pinch
The instability , increased pinch angle , and bronze contamination most likely	the rollers
When the first IFWU disengaged , all power demanded by the rotor system was transmitted to the remaining IFWU , which was worn and contaminated , causing it to fail within a very short time of the first failure , and total drive to the main rotor was lost	the loss of control of the helicopter
the first IFWU disengaged , all power demanded by the rotor system was transmitted to the remaining IFWU , which was worn and contaminated	it to fail within a very short time of the first failure
the material used	the Oilite bushings nor is there any requirement the material be completely sintered
The spiral bevel pinion and the main spiral bevel gears were misaligned during build-up at the time of the last main-rotor transmission overhaul and moved during operation	an abnormally high level of vibrations
Neither engine was	the maximum 123 per cent torque for the IFWUs
over torques/loading of the IFWUs	a failure
