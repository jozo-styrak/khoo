There was no ATC traffic advisory broadcast to either aircraft , and both were on VFR flight plans	, both crews had to rely solely on the see and be seen principle to avoid conflicts
the proximity and the tracks of the aircraft	it is likely that the Cessna pilot 's visual acquisition of the Twin Otter and his evasive action of a wings-level , straight-ahead descent prevented a midair collision
an area control centre is a very fluid and dynamic environment	attempting to match staffing levels with a fluctuating and at times unpredictable workload can be very challenging
one controller	When revising the day shift schedule , the midnight duty shift manager placed a high degree of importance on completing the training scheduled
his request was denied	he made no further attempt to address his concerns , nor did the shift manager
the shift supervisor been performing supervisory functions	the risk of an event taking place would have been reduced
the normal increase in IFR traffic	Between 1000 and 1018 , the workload of the YYJ terminal controller increased substantially
the controller radar identified the Twin Otter	he did not perceive a conflict with the Cessna
his workload	he was unable to complete the handoff briefing to the fourth controller , who had arrived at his scheduled start time
the time of the occurrence	the Victoria terminal complex was operating with three controllers -LRB- one of whom was on a break -RRB- when five were scheduled
each other in sufficient time	a conflict
ATC is obligated	traffic information aircraft operating within Class C airspace
this conflict	the pilots take action earlier
the Cessna pilot 's visual acquisition of the Twin Otter and his evasive action of a wings-level , straight-ahead descent	a midair collision
A sequence of events in the Victoria terminal complex , involving numerous decisions	the undetected conflict between the Cessna and the Twin Otter
the midnight duty shift manager	a high degree of importance
he	no further attempt address his concerns , nor did the shift manager
the perceived late arrival of the fourth controller , while he was already shorthanded	acting shift supervisor
the untimely opening and closing of control sectors	subsequent operating irregularities
he was	the handoff briefing to the fourth controller , who had arrived at his scheduled start time
each other in time	the conflict
His attention was divided among numerous tasks , including shift supervision	his radar-scanning technique
his	workload
task saturated	the prescribed handoff briefing to the new controller
