the severity of the breakup	it is unlikely that use of the shoulder harness straps would have reduced the severity of the injuries
both the destruction of the fuselage in the area of the attachments and the extra load created because the shoulder harnesses were not latched	The failure of the lap belt attachments at the airframe was likely

a mechanical failure	As there were no mechanical anomalies found with the glider , it is not likely that the steep climb was

a change in the winch speed	The same winch launch speed was used on the earlier flight , and it is therefore unlikely that the steep climb was
