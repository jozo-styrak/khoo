The gauge was calibrated a few months prior to the occurrence	, an unserviceability of the aircraft or one of its systems was ruled out
Rather than accurately determine the amount of fuel remaining when the flight had to be aborted , the company , referring to the regulation , allows a greater degree of operational flexibility to its pilots	, the onus is on the pilot , based on experience , knowledge and judgement , to decide when to abort the flight
It is possible that the sudden nature of the second engine stoppage , the release of the Bambi bucket and the low altitude could have been factors that delayed the lowering of the collective control to the minimum following the engine stoppage	, the decrease in rotor speed was constant and , because of very low rotor rpm on the landing flare , ground contact was not softened sufficiently to prevent substantial damage to the aircraft and serious injuries to its occupants
fuel exhaustion , which occurred after 2 hours 1 minute of flight	The engines stopped
monitoring gauge readings	calculating the quantity of remaining fuel and comparing the cruising range and the remaining flight time in order to decide when to refuel
his lack of experience with the Bell 212	a more complex aircraft than those he was used to flying
two hours may have had an effect on the pilot 's performance	Lastly , a somewhat short sleep period that was interrupted
a clear , specific company policy on fuel management been followed	fuel exhaustion would not have occurred
the pilot had elected to abort the flight when the FUEL LOW warning light illuminated	he have had sufficient fuel remaining to locate a suitable landing area
the collective is lowered to the stop position	rotor speed return to the prescribed range
very low rotor rpm on the landing flare , ground contact was not softened sufficiently to prevent substantial damage to the aircraft and serious injuries to its occupants	Accordingly , the decrease in rotor speed was constant and ,
the second engine stoppage occurred less than forty-four seconds later and before the passenger had time to send the message	the search began one hour following the accident
the G switch was mounted in the direction of flight	horizontally , it was less sensitive to the vertical impact sustained by the helicopter following the autorotation
fuel exhaustion as a result of poor fuel management and a questionable decision by the pilot to continue the flight despite a low fuel indication	The engines stopped
the pilot did not report the urgency of his situation by radio	The search was delayed
The relatively long intervals between training sessions and the SOPFEU contract , coupled with the lack of recency of his training	a deterioration of the pilot 's theoretical and technical knowledge and , consequently , poor fuel management
Also , the pilot was not given on-the-job training	him update his knowledge of the aircraft while carrying out his duties
Rather than accurately determine the amount of fuel remaining when the flight had to be aborted , the company , referring to the regulation	a greater degree of operational flexibility its pilots
Consequently , the onus is on the pilot	experience , knowledge and judgement
In this occurrence , the pilot 's experience in similar situations and his lack of familiarity with the aircraft were factors	him elect to continue the flight
It is possible that the sudden nature of the second engine stoppage , the release of the Bambi bucket and the low altitude could have been factors	the lowering of the collective control the minimum following the engine stoppage
he was	a forced landing and required fuel
The relatively long intervals between the pilot 's training sessions and his first commercial contract using a Bell 212 , coupled with the lack of recency of his training and his limited experience with this aircraft	a deterioration in the pilot 's theoretical and technical knowledge
