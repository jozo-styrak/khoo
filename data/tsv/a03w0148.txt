The history of the failed turbine blades could not be ascertained because they were maintained on condition	, the blades had been in service in this engine or other engines for an undetermined time
of the fatigue cracks could not be determined	Two turbine blades failed due to the overstress extension of pre-existing fatigue cracks , resulting in the substantial damage of the power turbine section and loss of engine power
the overstress extension of pre-existing fatigue cracks	The turbine blades failed
heat	It was not determined what initiated the cracks , but the most common initiators are mechanical damage -LRB- nicks -RRB- , manufacturing faults -LRB- inclusions or discontinuities -RRB- , corrosion and metallurgical deterioration
they were maintained on condition	The history of the failed turbine blades could not be ascertained
the engine failed	the undriven main rotor blades generated a considerable amount of drag , resulting in the rapid decay of the main rotor speed
the overstress extension of pre-existing fatigue cracks	Two turbine blades failed
When the engine failed , the undriven main rotor blades generated a considerable amount of drag	the rapid decay of the main rotor speed
This loss of rotor speed	the rotor system kinetic energy available to the pilot for control of the helicopter 's descent , and , combined with the low altitude , the attached load and airspeed delineated within the critical area of the H-V chart , thereby increasing the severity of the impact and injuries
