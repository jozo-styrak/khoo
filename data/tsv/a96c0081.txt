the difficulty in communications that might have resulted if the aircraft were handed off early	the East radar controller delayed transferring control of NW69 for as long as possible
the aircraft were handed off early , the East radar controller delayed transferring control of NW69 for as long as possible ; the controller	became preoccupied with data work rather than radar monitoring as NW69 left the sector
the workload in the North sector was high	the incoming North radar controller was not given a status briefing when he assumed that position
he had not yet completed the update , the NADS system was operating on outdated information	The data controller was updating the information in the NADS system , but ,
Although the NADS conflict warning indicated a six minute crossing time separation between NWT962 and NW69 , NWT962 was six minutes early	, the time separation decreased to nil
concentrating on the NADS system	the North controllers relied more on the NADS separation calculation to detect conflicts than on their analyses of the flight progress strips
deleting	the data tags of targets not under his control
the crew members were not expecting a descent clearance	they did not fully understand the message or the reason for it , and initially took no action
the controller had used phraseology such as that in MANOPS 507.1 , which incorporates the reason for the controller 's instruction	This confusion have been averted
the estimates	it harder
the East radar controller delayed	control of NW69 for as long as possible
the East radar controller	transferring control of NW69 for as long as possible
the time separation	to nil
Formulation of an accurate mental picture	more difficult by the lack of a co-located time estimate
The North radar controller 's IM setting	him avoid screen clutter by deleting the data tags of targets not under his control
the deletion of the data tags of the targets controlled by the sectors adjoining the North sector	his ability to detect information about the incoming NW69 , for which he had not yet accepted control
7 nm	the separation between the two aircraft
they	the crews visually acquire and monitor their aircraft traffic
the position estimates of the two flights	it more difficult for the North and East controllers to recognize the conflict between the flights
The East controller	NW69 's hand-off to the North sector in an attempt to avoid potential communications problems in the North sector
The North data controller 's workload	him providing the incoming North radar controller with a status briefing
The NADS system listed an incorrect separation warning at the time of the occurrence	an outdated time estimate for NWT962
The North radar controller 's IM setting	him receiving information about aircraft not under his control
Both aircraft TCAS systems	the respective crews visually acquire the other aircraft and monitor the situation
