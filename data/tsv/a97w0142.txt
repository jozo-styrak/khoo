Stretching his glide to cross a creek resulted in a decrease in rotor rpm , which affected the pilot 's ability to reduce the helicopter 's forward speed and rate of descent prior to touchdown	, the left skid dug into the ground and the helicopter rolled onto its right side
the disengagement of the drive shaft	It was concluded that the engine stopped when the engine driven fuel pump failed
the suddenness of the failure	the pilot had no warning that a problem existed
fuel starvation caused by the failure of the engine driven fuel pump	The engine stopped
excessive wear of the splines of the drive shaft and the driver gear	The engine driven fuel pump failed
The pilot was transiting at 100 feet agl when the power loss occurred	the number of landing sites available for an autorotation landing

Stretching his glide to cross a creek resulted in a decrease in rotor rpm	the pilot 's ability to reduce the helicopter 's forward speed and rate of descent prior to touchdown
ability	the helicopter 's forward speed and rate of descent prior to touchdown
the need to stretch the glide	the pilot to maintain rotor rpm to control the landing
the failure of the engine driven fuel pump	starvation
The pilot was flying at an altitude	his choices of landing sites for the autorotation
