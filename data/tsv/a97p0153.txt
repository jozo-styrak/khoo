two runways at a busy , international airport , lose separation with yet a third aircraft , and to conflict with several other aircraft in the vicinity	The pilot-controller communication errors made in the readback/hearback process led to the flight crew of one aircraft continuing descent to an altitude that could have been unsafe , and led to the flight crew of a second aircraft flying through the approach paths
the controller 's response immediately followed their initial-contact radio transmission	Despite the call-sign for ACA109 being clearly at the beginning of the controller 's communication , the crew of ACA897 had assumed that the approach clearance -LRB- intended for ACA109 -RRB- was directed to them
such an approach clearance would have been appropriate for their aircraft and circumstances	the pilots of ACA897 believed
ACA897 had accepted it so quickly	and because the controller had acknowledged the read-back
At 1453:14 , before ACA109 had turned toward the localizer , the controller planned a procedure of vertical separation between ACA109 and MAL7072 , whereby he would maintain 1,000 feet between them	his instruction for ACA109 to maintain 2,000 feet
this time	there was ample room for the controller to manoeuvre the aircraft to maintain the required separation standard of either 1,000 feet vertically or 3 nm horizontally
the word maintain	does not imply any level of immediacy or urgency
ACA109 still being at 3,000 feet , and continuing	to remain at that altitude until well after the loss of separation had occurred
ATC instruction	ACA109 began a left turn after crossing the localizers
The circumstances of this incident	the investigation to focus on the readback/hearback process
The pilot-controller communication errors made in the readback/hearback process	the flight crew of one aircraft continuing descent to an altitude that could have been unsafe , and led to the flight crew of a second aircraft flying through the approach paths for two runways at a busy , international airport , lose separation with yet a third aircraft , and to conflict with several other aircraft in the vicinity
The chain of events starting at 1453:14	this incident was circumstantial and comprised many elements
Nevertheless , they accepted and began to follow a clearance	the aircraft below MVA
His corrective actions were appropriate	the loss of separation had ACA109 reacted correctly and in a timely fashion to his instructions to turn to a heading of 230 and maintain 2,000 feet
aircraft	them
In these circumstances , the controller had no other option than to issue significant heading vectors to the aircraft to place them on diverging headings - a course of action	the risk of collision
The captain of ACA897 accepted a clearance	the aircraft to descend below a minimum safe altitude
