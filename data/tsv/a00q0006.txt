for the decision to head towards the mountain is still undetermined	The pilot might have maintained his south-westerly direction over Lake Adonis to gain more altitude before heading towards the rising ground
The pre-flight safety briefing did not inform passengers where to find the survival equipment on board the aircraft	, they could not use the sleeping bags to protect themselves from exposure and thereby delay hypothermia
Rescue was late because the mostly white aircraft blended into the snowy ground , making it difficult to locate , and the ELT antenna was broken , reducing the range of the signal	, the survivors ' exposure time was increased
the form does not allow the pilot to know the exact position of the centre of gravity	However , the company 's use of a ready-to-use weight and balance form is irregular
the minimum damage to the cabin , aft of the two front seats	The accident was survivable
one passenger who managed to get out despite difficulty in moving	The passengers were trapped inside the aircraft except
they known	they could have used the sleeping bags to protect themselves from exposure and thereby delay hypothermia
pilots direct their attention outside	their attention to the instrument readings , such as aircraft speed , decreases
the aircraft was not equipped with a stall warning system	the pilot might have realized too late that the speed was too low to maintain normal climb performance
the flaps were up	Further , the vibration precursory to stalling , as described in the flight manual , would have been minimal
the mostly white aircraft blended into the snowy ground , making it difficult to locate	Rescue was late
the broken ELT antenna , which reduced the transmission range of the ELT 's signal , and the colour of the aircraft , which was mostly white and blended into the snowy ground	to locate the aircraft
Efforts to locate the aircraft were hampered by the broken ELT antenna	the transmission range of the ELT 's signal , and the colour of the aircraft , was mostly white and blended into the snowy ground
themselves from exposure	hypothermia
There was nothing	the pilot gaining altitude while flying over Lake Adonis since the aircraft was not overloaded , the cloud layer did not constitute a ceiling , visibility was good
an untimely event in the cabin	no indication that the pilot
The surrounding terrain may create an optical illusion affecting the perception of the terrain being overflown	underestimation of the slope
The surrounding terrain	an optical illusion affecting the perception of the terrain being overflown , leading to underestimation of the slope
an optical illusion	the perception of the terrain being overflown
The pilot was likely using cutback power to make the climb	the aircraft 's climb
cutback power	the climb
the slope of the terrain	establishing the aircraft 's climb when leaving the shore
The aircraft 's speed would have decreased	climb performance
The pilot 's decision to fly at low altitude contributed to putting the aircraft at a reduced distance from the ground	insufficient altitude recover when the aircraft stalled
The prevailing conditions were	optical illusions associated with low-altitude flight over rising terrain
themselves from exposure	hypothermia
Rescue was late because the mostly white aircraft blended into the snowy ground	it difficult to locate
the mostly white aircraft blended into the snowy ground , making it difficult to locate , and the ELT antenna was broken	the range of the signal
The autopsy and toxicological test results	no indication physiological factors affected the pilot 's performance
test	no indication
no indication that physiological factors	the pilot 's performance
