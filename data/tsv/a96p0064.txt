Since no causal mechanical deficiencies with the engine or helicopter were found , this analysis concentrates on the operational factors of this accident	of the engine examination , it was concluded that the engine was not delivering significant power at impact , although capable of doing so
Although the engine throttle control was found in the closed position , there is evidence to conclude that it was moved by impact forces	, snow ingestion remains as the most likely reason for the engine stopping in flight
the success of the test cell runs and the FCU examinations , and in the absence of any contaminant found in the fuel system	it is unlikely that contamination of the FCU caused an uncommanded deceleration and led to the accident

the rpm had already decayed	likely have rendered the helicopter uncontrollable , leading to inevitable impact with the surface
snow ingestion	The helicopter engine flamed out in flight , likely
the indications to the pilot would have been similar to those resulting from an engine flame-out	the pilot the same operational options
a malfunction of the engine 's fuel control unit -LRB- FCU -RRB-	deceleration
The FCU examination and disassembly	no abnormalities
It is possible that foreign matter had entered the FCU at some time	it malfunction
contamination of the FCU caused an uncommanded deceleration	the accident
contamination of the FCU	an uncommanded deceleration

The in-flight circumstances immediately preceding the engine stoppage could not be determined ; however , when the helicopter struck the trees during the last stage of descent , the main rotor rpm would have been reduced and , if the rpm had already decayed , likely would have rendered the helicopter uncontrollable	inevitable impact with the surface

Records indicate that the helicopter was certificated and maintained in accordance with existing regulations , and no evidence was found of any pre-impact failure or malfunction	the accident
