the anti-skid system was deactivated	the wheels locked
A film of slush and water that accumulated on the runway was	hydroplaning but not of sufficient depth to be visible to the crew on approach
The reduced braking action on the wet runway	the aircraft decelerating normally with the anti-skid brake system activated
the fact that an anti-skid brake system	a better braking action than a conventional braking system
the hydroplaning	the braking action near nil
to the aircraft	a shorter landing distance
The aircraft main landing gear tires hydroplaned on landing roll	the aircraft braking action
