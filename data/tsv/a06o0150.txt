The damage to the fourth-stage compressor wheel was consistent with overstress damage caused by the liberation of the third-stage compressor blades	, this analysis will focus on the failure of the third-stage compressor wheel and the subsequent hard landing and rollover
However , if the fatigue cracks were present during the last overhaul , it would be reasonable to assume that they would have been noticed during the FPI of the third-stage wheel	, it is likely that the progressive failure developed at some point after the last overhaul
The 17 compressor blades that failed due to a progressive type of failure were covered in oxidation from the post-crash fire	, a propagation rate could not be determined
a progressive type of failure	The 17 compressor blades that failed
the fatigue cracks were present during the last overhaul	it be reasonable to assume that they would have been noticed during the FPI of the third-stage wheel
overstress at normal operating loads	However , when a progressive failure crack reaches a critical size , the remaining blade section fails
a progressive failure crack reaches a critical size	the remaining blade section fails due to overstress at normal operating loads
the	failure of the third-stage compressor wheel
the liberation of the third-stage compressor blades	overstress damage
Metallurgical examination could not determine the initiating event	the progressive cracks on a number of the third-stage compressor blade roots
It is likely that the third-stage compressor wheel experienced this type of blade failure	destruction of the third - and fourth-stage compressor wheels
Stretching the glide in an attempt to reach a suitable landing area resulted in a loss of main rotor rpm	a hard landing
the glide in an attempt to reach a suitable landing area	a loss of main rotor
The liberated compressor blades	severe internal damage the third - and fourth-stage compressor wheels
