Based on the pilot 's knowledge of the area north of Vancouver , he had come to expect sporadic radio coverage in the high terrain and , because these communication difficulties were normally encountered and therefore anticipated , he did not consider them to be valid communication failures	, his motivation to initiate the loss of communication procedures published in the CFS was reduced
the aircraft crossed the MVA line	the controller gave the next step-down clearance to an altitude of 11 000 feet asl
handing off the aircraft to the arrival controller	After clearing the aircraft to 11 000 feet asl , the controller increased his range of visual scan in preparation
When operating below published minimum altitudes , there is no independent means for aircrew to easily cross-check MVA boundaries with published information available in the cockpit	, the crew 's ability to recognize or compensate for the controller 's error was greatly reduced
Based on the pilot 's knowledge of the area north of Vancouver , he had come to expect sporadic radio coverage in the high terrain and , because these communication difficulties were normally encountered	anticipated , he did not consider them to be valid communication failures
the en route controller anticipated that the aircrew would try to contact the next sector on its route of flight and had the arrival controller known about the problem	the arrival controller could have directed the aircraft to climb immediately on initial contact
ABL814 crossed the en route sector 's 14 000-foot MVA line	the en route air traffic controller
the aircraft 's low altitude	The controller 's attempts to recover from the error were impeded by a lack of direct controller-pilot communications capability
he was unaware of the communication problem , directed the crew to return to their previously assigned en route frequency	The arrival controller received a transmission from ABL814 but ,
the crew could see the mountains	There was no risk of collision with terrain
A light traffic load in the en route sector	the controller to concentrate his visual scan on the one aircraft being controlled
This concentration on one area of the radar display	the controller 's ability
the time he	the error
he had	a descent clearance 14
the controller	the next step-down clearance an altitude of 11 000 feet asl
the controller	his range of visual scan in preparation for handing off the aircraft to the arrival controller
the fact they	levelling at 11 000 feet asl
an MVA when that aircraft is not being radar vectored	confusion about whether the pilot or the controller has responsibility for obstacle and terrain clearance
an error by the controller in assigning an incorrect altitude can not be cross-checked by the pilot	an aircraft descending below a minimum IFR altitude
the defences designed	minimum acceptable obstacle and terrain clearance aircraft in flight
Local interpretation of existing rules and procedures	an erosion of the defences designed to provide minimum acceptable obstacle and terrain clearance for aircraft in flight
this	the time
The Vancouver ACC was using an altitude assignment procedure	controllers assign altitudes that were below the minimum published IFR altitudes
TP 308	no direct mention of a requirement for direct pilot-to-controller communication capabilities either at or below the MVA
