extensive damage caused by the fire	the investigation could not determine the cause of the lost oil
the oil level is at the minimum	According to the engine manufacturer , the engine windmill for several minutes even
that quantity of leaked oil had contributed to the fire	there is a strong possibility that this have happened before or just after the engine started windmilling
the engine was turning at reduced rpm -LRB- windmilling -RRB-	the reduced quantity of oil was adequate
lubrication had become inadequate	the engine , in the worst case , seize and stop but would not incur major damage and catch fire
The shaft between the high-pressure compressor and the accessory gearbox was intact	the accessory gearbox was being driven and was turning until the landing
the quantity and supply of oil was limited	lubrication to the accessory gearbox was inadequate
