Although the pilot did not observe any ice on the wings during the descent , it is likely that ice adhering to the wings would not have been discerned by flashlight on the wing 's white background	this ice would have had on the aircraft 's performance could not be quantified ; however , when attempting to level-off at 2 100 feet asl during the descent , the aircraft continued to descend and the 2 100 feet asl assigned altitude was regained slowly despite full application of power
this ice would have	the aircraft 's performance could not be quantified
this information	it is reasonable to conclude that airframe icing would have been more severe as the aircraft continued its descent through this freezing precipitation
a combination of the build-up of ice on the lifting surfaces , the moderate turbulence on the approach , and the higher than normal aircraft weight plus the weight of the accumulate ice	While this could be wholly attributable to airframe icing , it would be more reasonable to conclude that the aircraft stalled
this information would have	the pilot 's decision to continue the flight
occurrence	the
aircraft and pilot inspections are no longer conducted by Transport Canada prior to transoceanic crossings	these shortcomings are less likely to be detected
aircraft	icing
occurrence	the
the winds on the approach had been reported as high as 60 knots prior to the accident	the moderate and severe turbulence as cautioned in the top left hand of the approach chart
These winds	significant airspeed fluctuations for the accident aircraft
These winds would have resulted in significant airspeed fluctuations for the accident aircraft	the controllability of the aircraft
his	decision to undertake the flight and accept the risks posed by a descent through known icing in clouds
a SIGMET	their area of control
