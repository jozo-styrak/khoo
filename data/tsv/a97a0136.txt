the weather at the oil rig was too poor to allow for landing and refuelling	The flight was prolonged
the return flight were now more restrictive than if they had landed at the rig and refueled	This placed the crew in the situation where they were unable to accomplish the intended mission and while they had sufficient fuel in accordance with regulations , the available time and options
Air traffic control clearance to the airport and then for descent were received while the aircraft was still a substantial distance from landing	, the pre-landing check was delayed until the aircraft was closer to landing
the higher than ideal speed , the aircraft went high on the glidepath , which required the crew to make several power adjustments to slow down and then regain the desired approach profile	The aircraft then intercepted the glidepath and ,
When the aircraft reached decision height it was still 164 feet above ground	the radar altimeter altitude warnings activated , sometime after decision height was reached , during the time that the captain had assumed manual control and was slowing down and flaring for the touchdown
it was travelling faster than 60 knots so the landing gear warning had not yet activated	but
their similar characteristics were misinterpreted as an anticipated and non-critical advisory , in which case the landing gear warning went unrecognized	It is also most likely that the radar altimeter and landing warnings occurred in close succession and
the flight and duty times were within allowable guidelines	The crew were certified and qualified
several other factors combined in this occurrence	a situation
This	the crew in the situation
they were	the intended mission
the ceiling and visibility were	and
the decision was	to maintain their cruising speed and delay slowing down to their normal approach speed
their cruising speed	slowing down to their normal approach speed
the discussion regarding the missed approach intentions	enough of a distraction the crew missed completing the pre-landing check that they had previously delayed
The aircraft then intercepted the glidepath and , because of the higher than ideal speed , the aircraft went high on the glidepath , which required the crew	several power adjustments slow down and then regain the desired approach profile
several power adjustments	and
the captain had assumed manual control	and
during the time that the captain	and
the co-pilot	several verbal calls were being
the captain	some verbal acknowledgements were being
The crew	the pre-landing check and then
