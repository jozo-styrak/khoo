The crash site location reveals that the pilot entered the area of deteriorating weather and reduced visibility	likely that he encountered similar conditions to those reported by the pilots who had flown through the narrows before him
The aircraft had flown more than 60 hours after being accepted back into service following the wing repair and was reported to have had no documented unserviceabilities raised against it by either of the company pilots	, the possibility of a causal link between the previous repair activity and the current accident is considered unlikely
, at the time they were made , he was flying westward in the Peace Arm and was outside radio coverage	Although specific information about these deteriorating weather conditions had been discussed on the radio by two other pilots , the pilot of the accident aircraft would not likely have heard these transmissions
the pilot reported out of the Peace Arm at 1320	the company dispatcher informed him that the visibility at Mackenzie had dropped to two miles
Although informed of the deteriorating visibility , the pilot did not contact the Prince George FSS for a weather update	, he would not have been aware of the new terminal forecast for Mackenzie effective at 1300
the pilot did not report any ongoing problem to the dispatcher or the FSS , it is likely that this accident occurred suddenly , and with little warning	The precipitating cause of this accident is not known ; however ,
accident is not known	this
the weather was known to be below VMC	the risk of inadvertently striking the terrain while in controlled flight was increased
The yellow material found wedged in a fracture adjacent to the outboard trailing edge of the left horizontal stabilizer was not identified , nor was there sufficient physical evidence to conclude that it was part of the object	the damage
the overstress and failure of the seat restraint systems	The likelihood of survival in this case would be low
a localized disturbance related to embedded ACC/TCU clouds	Over the period of this flight , the weather from Scott Creek , at the northern end of the Williston Lake narrows , through to Mackenzie dropped below VMC
The source of a small piece of yellow material found wedged in the fracture adjacent to the outboard trailing edge of the left horizontal stabilizer was not identified , nor was there sufficient physical evidence to conclude that it was part of the object	the damage
A complicated weather pattern was	the area
weather	visibility
the degraded weather had	those pilots to descend to about 200 feet agl maintain visual reference with the shoreline
The lack of radio calls on frequency 126.7 MHz , as noted on both the outbound and return legs of this trip	the risk the flight by degrading the continuity of the flight-following
The lack of radio transmissions increased the risk of meeting opposing traffic in narrow areas of the lake	the opportunity for other aircraft or FSS facilities to communicate pertinent information related to weather or flight safety
