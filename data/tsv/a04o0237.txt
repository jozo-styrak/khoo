From their training , they would be predisposed to assume that a pitch control jam would result in an inability to move the control column	, they did not associate the difficulty in holding the control column forward as an indication of a pitch control jam
The balancing and the independent inspection of the spring tab were carried out approximately one month before the occurrence	, many of the specific details about how the work was done were not available
it had been removed at least once to grind material off in the attempt to balance the spring tab	down , confirming
the nuts installed	the bolts migrated out of the weights
the elevator loads	As well , they would not have been aware that such a condition could potentially overstress the tail of the aircraft
the pitch control anomaly	After declaring an emergency
the outboard weight fell off	the bolts jammed on the top surface of the elevator
overstressing the aircraft with increased airspeed	The training and checklists provided to the flight crew members did not provide them with sufficient means to identify the nature of the anomaly , nor were they made aware of the potential
There was nothing in the training provided to the flight crew nor in the QRH	them to recognize the symptoms of a jammed spring tab
This lack of information	them continuing the flight to destination rather than landing at the nearest suitable airport
a pitch control jam	an inability to move the control column
the flaps	the aircraft to accelerate
in turn	the bolts migrate out of the weights
