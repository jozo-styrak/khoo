There have been no other similar actuator failures reported , and despite extensive testing by the manufacturers , the noted failure of the S/N115 actuator could not be duplicated	, the uncommanded output tube movement of this specific unit remains an isolated occurrence that was likely caused by the effects of undefined repeated loading conditions , which progressively forged the actuator no-back rollers into a configuration that ultimately prevented them from holding the actuator output tubes in position against the stabilizer flight loads
recovery of the aircraft	the successful
an aerodynamic stall and the probable loss of aircraft control	avoiding
undefined repeated loading conditions , which progressively forged the actuator no-back rollers into a configuration	ultimately prevented them from holding the actuator output tubes in position against the stabilizer flight loads
The rapid onset of the pitch-up and the steep attitude achieved	accurate assessment of the pitch angle very difficult
The crew 's immediate and coordinated action was	avoiding an aerodynamic stall and the probable loss of aircraft control
The pitch-trim actuator , S/N 115 , failed in a condition	the horizontal stabilizer trim surface of the aircraft to move to an extreme travel position thereby causing an immediate and rapid uncommanded nose-up deviation of the aircraft
an extreme travel position	an immediate and rapid uncommanded nose-up deviation of the aircraft
Failure of the no-back restraint	the subsequent failure of a bearing in the actuator geartrain
Under normal circumstances , the geartrain , in conjunction with the motor brake	a redundant system will hold the stabilizer load should the no-back mechanism fail
The combined failures of the no-back mechanism and of the gear bearing	the uncommanded motion of the actuator output tubes and stabilizer
the effects of undefined repeated loading conditions , which progressively forged the actuator no-back rollers into a configuration that ultimately prevented them from holding the actuator output tubes in position against the stabilizer flight loads	the uncommanded output tube movement of this specific unit remains an isolated occurrence
Therefore , the uncommanded output tube movement of this specific unit remains an isolated occurrence that was likely caused by the effects of undefined repeated loading conditions , which progressively forged the actuator no-back rollers into a configuration	them holding the actuator output tubes in position against the stabilizer flight loads
Neither the teardown of the actuator nor the examination of the aircraft	the source of the repeated heavy loading
The physical force required	the nose-up force of the horizontal stabilizer
air loads	the no back mechanisms
