The primary focus was on maintaining that attitude , even though in reality the helicopter must have been descending	, as indicated in the Transport Canada instrument manual , the crew 's cross-check was hampered by prolonged ` eye rest ' on the attitude indicator
they may be in clear air	As stated in Transport Canada 's Aeronautical Information Publication , the real hazard in whiteout is that pilots do not suspect the phenomenon
the recirculation anticipated and planned a vertical take-off	The crew did not discuss the whiteout hazard ; however , the crew correctly identified the loose snow as an imminent danger
terrain sloping downward	the
the vertical take-off was not executed in accordance with the SOPs	the time that the helicopter was in the recirculating snow was extended
the radio altimeter was set to 200 feet above ground level	the decision height light would have remained on throughout the procedure and would have given no indication as the helicopter descended into the terrain
prolonged	` eye rest ' on the attitude indicator
prolonged ` eye rest ' on the attitude indicator and the slow instrument scan	These factors may have accounted for the tendency
entering white-out conditions was masked by the visibility of objects in the vicinity of the departure point	The potential
recirculating	snow
The vertical take-off itself	the threat of white-out
The choice of departure path	the threat of white-out
the helicopter was	to drift backwards
Several factors	the PNF to misidentify a climb
this	the appearance of a climb
the decision height light would have remained on throughout the procedure	no indication
An instantaneous vertical speed indicator	the crew more timely information about the helicopter 's vertical movement
the PNF	the power change from 110 % to 100 %
the PF did	these tendencies
the decision was	to rotate into the transition after vertical momentum had been lost
This	his lack of proficiency in accomplishing a vertical take-off and also increased his workload
This likely contributed to his lack of proficiency in accomplishing a vertical take-off	his workload
environmental conditions	white-out and loss of micro texture for attitude reference
an adequate instrument scan	the white-out conditions
the rapid instrument scan required	the pilot flying 's minimal experience on type
