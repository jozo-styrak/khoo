cloud height is near VFR limits	the implication can be significant , whether VFR flight is permitted or not
the crew of PCO909 been advised that the weather may have deteriorated to less than VFR minima	the crew could have formulated an alternate arrival plan , thereby avoiding the resulting conflict
the actual flight path flown is not characteristic of the stated or implied procedure	ambiguity and confusion for other airport traffic result in conflict
the crew of PCO909 found themselves facing deteriorating weather and traffic closing in on their position	the decision was made to abort their VFR arrival
entering the Campbell River MF area under VFR while in instrument flight conditions	By continuing straight ahead or turning to the right , the flight crew would have been faced with weather conditions below VFR limits and a possible regulatory infraction
the aircraft was equipped with TCAS and was being monitored	the crew continued with their approach
making a left turn	the element of surprise and a TCAS RA resulted in GLR689 deviating slightly to the left and executing the missed approach procedure
This	greater responsibility for traffic detection and spacing
the Nav Canada FSS Manual of Operations , sections 411.9 and 411.10 , discusses the airport advisory service	specialists
communications on the MF	the defence
Timely and complete reports of position and intentions improve situational awareness for all concerned	the opportunity conflict detection and resolution
Non-adherence to published circuit procedures have	midair collisions
a heading perpendicular to the runway	a right-hand , 90-degree turn onto the final approach course
ambiguity and confusion for other airport traffic	conflict
the decision was	to abort their VFR arrival
The crew of GLR689	their speed to remain behind PCO909
the element of surprise and a TCAS RA	GLR689
The reported 0800 weather conditions	visual flight rules -LRB- VFR -RRB-
As PCO909 entered the control zone , the flight encountered weather conditions below VFR minima	the crew aborting the arrival
it	a risk of collision with GLR689 , which was established on final approach
A delayed and incomplete inbound report from PCO909 reduced situational awareness for all concerned and , thereby	the opportunity for conflict detection and resolution
A delayed and incomplete inbound report from PCO909	situational awareness for all concerned and , thereby , reduced the opportunity for conflict detection and resolution
ambiguity and confusion for other airport traffic	an increased risk of conflict
Deviations from published procedures or stated intentions	ambiguity and confusion for other airport traffic and
flight under instrument flight rules -LRB- IFR -RRB-	delays
