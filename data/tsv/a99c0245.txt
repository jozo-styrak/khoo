The fact that the engine operated normally with fuel being fed from the front tank during the previous flight indicates that the front tank fuel was probably uncontaminated at that time	, the contamination was likely introduced into the front tank while the aircraft was at Big Trout Lake
The engine operated normally during the flight , using fuel from the rear and centre tanks , and the power loss occurred after the front tank had been selected	, the water contamination was likely confined to the front tank
The company reported that it has not experienced any other contamination problems using fuel transported in jerry cans	, it is likely the water contamination came from the drums into which the fuel was poured just before the aircraft was refuelled
only the front tank was contaminated	it is probable that only one of the two drums was contaminated
The filter on the hand-operated wobble pump was not designed to prevent water contamination	, water from the drum would have been transferred into the aircraft 's fuel system
the tank sumps are at the rear of the tank	it is possible that the nose-level attitude prevented the water from reaching the sump for the pre-flight fuel sample
heat from the engine , exhaust system , and cabin heating system	Any ice in the tank could have melted
the pilot selected the front tank en route	the water entered the fuel lines and migrated to the carburetor and into the engine , resulting in a loss of power
the aircraft fuel system was contaminated with a large amount of water	The engine quit operating
the nose-level attitude	the water reaching the sump for the pre-flight fuel sample
When the pilot selected the front tank en route , the water entered the fuel lines and migrated to the carburetor and into the engine	a loss of power
However , regardless of throttle position or tank selection , it is unlikely that the contamination would have been eliminated or the engine would have restarted	the extent of the water contamination and
the use of the shoulder harnesses	to prevent injuries
the use of the shoulder harnesses helped	injuries
filter	water contamination
The nose-level aircraft attitude when beached and the freezing of water	the water contamination being drained from the front tank during the pilot 's pre-flight checks
The use of the available shoulder harnesses	serious injury the pilot and engineer
