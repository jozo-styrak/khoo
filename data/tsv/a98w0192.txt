of the fatigue cracking could not be determined	The engine failed when one blade in the 6th stage HPC failed at the blade root due to high-cycle fatigue fractures
of the fatigue cracking could not be determined	The engine failure was precipitated by one blade in the 6th stage high-pressure compressor failing due to high-cycle fatigue cracking
high-cycle fatigue fractures	The engine failed when one blade in the 6th stage HPC failed at the blade root
the unresolved nature of the occurrence	Communications on the Calgary ground frequency were complicated
high-cycle fatigue cracking	The engine failure was precipitated by one blade in the 6th stage high-pressure compressor failing
the use of the ground control frequency for the continued operation of aircraft	Communications between the pilots and the air traffic control authority and the airport emergency response team were complicated after landing
However , the volume of transmissions did cause the flight crew concern that they might miss vital communications	the safety of the passengers , AER ground crew , and flight crew
