one of the 2nd stage rotor blades	High cycle fatigue fracture was confirmed
FOD was a precursor	, it could not be concluded
something was ingested into the compressor at that time , leaving the mark observed on the 1st stage blade	impact , and it is possible
the debris in which the piece of aluminum rivet was found was collected among general debris found in the engine cowl area after the accident	it can not be positively linked to the presence of the small particle of aluminum in the impact mark
these observations	FOD can not be ruled out
high cycle fatigue , which had initiated at	The compressor failure resulted from the separation of a 2nd stage rotor blade
the absence of any fractographic evidence near the fatigue initiation zone	its influence as a probable fatigue crack initiator in the 2nd stage rotor blade inconclusive
Post-fracture mechanical damage in the origin area	determination of the cause of fatigue initiation
