The helicopter was positioned too far from shore to provide adequate visual references for longline operations , and it is likely that the water bucket inadvertently entered the water while the helicopter was transitioning from a hover taxi to a hover	of the water bucket may have caused the helicopter to swing downwards , and there was insufficient time , altitude , or visual references to prevent the helicopter from striking the water
having a high potential for engine mechanical or structural damage , the backward movement of the compressor blades had no effect on the engine operation during this event	Except
military and commercial parts may have the same part number	it is essential to cross reference the CAGE code of the parts so as to trace their origin and confirm their authorized use in commercial aircraft
a distance of 1000 feet from shore	the pilot would not have been able to adequately judge the helicopter 's forward speed and altitude above the water
the	water bucket may have caused the helicopter to swing downwards
Many military and commercial parts share the same part numbers	the accompanying tag is not sufficient to confirm that the part is authorized for commercial use
the similarity between the stickers	misidentification of the fuel product
Extensive examination of the engine and FCU did not reveal any anomaly or defect	or caused a loss of power to the engine
The lack of a CAGE code on the accompanying tag	the issuance of a certificate of airworthiness without the benefit of complete and adequate documentation
All of these observations	the conclusion that the helicopter systems were operating within the normal parameters at the time of impact
This	the vibrations and tugging felt by the pilot and the loadmaster
The application of collective and forward cyclic	the helicopter to pendulum swing toward the surface of the water
there was insufficient time , altitude or visual references	the helicopter striking the water
The pilot-in-command was not wearing the available shoulder harness during longline operations	the severity of his injuries
shore	adequate visual references longline operations
references	the helicopter striking the water
The anchor effect of the water bucket	the helicopter to swing downwards
The pilot was not wearing the available shoulder harness during longline operations	the severity of his injuries
the similarity between the stickers	misidentification of the fuel product
The lack of a CAGE code on the accompanying tag	the issuance of a certificate of airworthiness without the benefit of complete and adequate documentation
