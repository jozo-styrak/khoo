the converging tracks , he probably would have placed a range bearing line -LRB- RBL -RRB- between the two aircraft to determine the exact distance between them	Had the controller been aware of a possible conflict
the controller been aware of a possible conflict because of the converging tracks	he
the controller had heard the Moncton controller 's warning	he have been alerted to the crossing traffic situation
the controller did not listen completely	In this case , important information in a hotline conversation was missed
he re-routed AFR055 direct to St. John 's	he should have looked at the radar display where he could have detected the conflict with MPH806 at that time
the controller re-routed AFR055 direct to St. John 's	he did not confirm whether the turn would create a conflict with other traffic
human error rather than limitations in ability	The controller 's demonstrated ability during performance reviews suggests that the incidents involving the controller -LRB- 3 in 17 months -RRB- were
a disciplinary letter in the controller 's file as a corrective action	the controller more aware of his job responsibilities in the future
TCAS equipment on board the two aircraft and the quick response of the flight crews	a mid-air collision
part of the RDPS software	a safety alert a degradation of radar service
An operational conflict alert function as part of the RDPS software would also provide a safety alert for a degradation of radar service	a loss of separation or risk of collision not otherwise detected by controllers
the turn	a conflict with other traffic
TCAS equipment on board the two aircraft	a more serious risk of collision
part of the RDPS software	to detect risks of collision that otherwise go undetected
