heat is generated during the tensioning process	any increase in the tensioning time will increase the heat transfer to the belts
the Robinson R-22 's low-inertia rotor system	recovery under these conditions is virtually impossible , even with the collective fully down
problem	the engagement
shrinkage due to excess heat	At some point after installation , both V-drive belts were subjected to changes in dimension , probably
excess heat	At some point after installation , both V-drive belts were subjected to changes in dimension , probably as a result of shrinkage
some point after installation	both V-drive belts were subjected to changes in dimension , probably as a result of shrinkage due to excess heat
The presence of corrosion on both the in-line fuse and fuse terminal , coupled with the poor solder joint	an increase in resistance in the electrical circuit the belt-tension actuator motor
This	or
Slow operation of the actuator motor	the time required to properly tension the belts
any increase in the tensioning time	the heat transfer the belts
Any change to the dimensions of the belts after installation	a change the original rigging and alignment of the upper drive shaft
Mis-alignment of the drive train sheaves is known	drive train failure
any belt mismatch	the shorter of the belts tensioning first and taking a higher percentage of the engine power
An excess of horsepower being applied to the drive belt system is known	the risk of belt failure
the main rotor rpm	and
Although tapping the tensioner motor to initiate engagement appeared to have worked as a temporary fix , it is not an approved maintenance procedure and , in part	an incorrect conclusion that the tensioner motor was the underlying cause of the engagement problem
The correct use of the Maintenance Manual 's Clutch Actuator Electrical Trouble-shooting Guide	an opportunity to identify the electrical defects that were subsequently noted following the accident
Use of a 10-amp fuse in place of the required 1.5-amp fuse in the electrical circuit to the belt tensioning actuator eliminated the intended defence and , under certain circumstances	the actuator over-tension
Any changes to belt length	the risk of the belts
Corrosion on an in-line fuse end and improper connection of the fuse holder raised the resistance in the electrical circuit to the belt-tensioner	the operation of the belt-tension actuator motor
This slower operation	an increase in tensioning time and in belt temperature during engagement/disengagement , which likely precipitated the belt shrinkage
During the latter stages of the autorotation , the helicopter 's main-rotor rpm was allowed to drop below safe limits	insufficient rotor energy
the helicopter 's main-rotor rpm was	to drop below safe limits , resulting in insufficient rotor energy to arrest the descent
Use of a work-around procedure to engage the actuator motor -LRB- tapping the motor -RRB-	the risk of component failure
Use of a 10-amp fuse in place of the required 1.5-amp fuse in the electrical circuit to the belt-tension actuator motor eliminated the intended defence and , under certain circumstances	the actuator over-tension
