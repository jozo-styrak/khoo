The conditions listed as being shimmy initiation factors appear to be normal landing conditions for this class of aircraft	, it would appear that the problem relates to the overall landing gear design
The original excitation of the oscillations	the shimmy could not be determined , but it would appear that two factors allowed the oscillations to continue and amplify
two factors	the oscillations continue and amplify
The additional clearances in the T/L pins and bushings which reduced the dampening capability of the T/Ls ; and The excessive nitrogen pressure in the oleo	the oleo compressing immediately at touchdown
bushings	the dampening capability of the T/Ls
The aircraft had not been in service for a sufficient length of time to require this operator 's mid-life inspection on the gear	the excessive clearances
Changes in tolerances , whether from wear , overhaul , servicing , etc. , compromise the margin of shimmy control	torque link failure
Changes in tolerances , whether from wear , overhaul , servicing , etc. ,	the margin of shimmy control , which can lead to torque link failure
The left main gear began to shimmy immediately after touchdown	failure of the upper torque link and eventual separation of the wheels from the axles
The aircraft landing configuration and other landing conditions were	the initiation of landing gear shimmy
the previous overhaul	the torque links controlling and eliminating the shimmy
The nitrogen pressure in the oleo exceeded the pressure specified in the maintenance manual	the oleo 's stiffness
