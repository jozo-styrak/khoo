he could not get full travel on the left propeller lever	After the left engine lost power , the pilot tried to shut the engine down but was unable to feather the left propeller
there is very little clearance between the propeller governor control and the number two cylinder	the number two cylinder was in a position to interfere with the operation of the propeller governor control after it separated , preventing full travel of the propeller lever
the base nut did not receive the required torque during installation or if the base nut lost its clamping force during engine operation	The missing base nut of the through stud indicates that the base nut did not have sufficient clamping force ; however , it not be determined
the required clamping force of the lower - inch hold-down point of the number two cylinder	the remaining studs took on the load of the cylinder and eventually failed in fatigue
the base nut did not receive the required torque during installation or if the base nut lost its clamping force during engine operation	The missing base nut of the through stud indicates that the base nut did not have sufficient clamping force ; however , it not be determined
interference between the propeller governor control and the separated number two cylinder	The left propeller could not be feathered
The drag from the unfeathered left propeller and the deformed left engine cowling	the aircraft
Because there is very little clearance between the propeller governor control and the number two cylinder , the number two cylinder was in a position to interfere with the operation of the propeller governor control after it separated	full travel of the propeller lever
With the separation of the number two cylinder , engine oil and raw fuel from the severed fuel injector line likely sprayed onto the hot exhaust stack	the smoke and fire that eventually destroyed the aircraft
the pilot was able to maintain control of the aircraft during the approach	a very gradual descent
the pilot was	control of the aircraft during the approach
the lower rear base nut of the number two cylinder	torque insufficient clamping force
The number three cylinder lower forward through stud was missing its base nut	the lower rear base nut of the number two cylinder loosen
The drag from the unfeathered left propeller and the deformed left engine cowling	the aircraft
