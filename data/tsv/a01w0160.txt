The controller did not use appropriate procedures to mark the flight progress strips for ACA3697 and CDR8510 to indicate inappropriate altitudes or potential conflicts	, two aircraft converged with a clearance to the same altitude
The problem the controller faced was to descend ACA3697 to an appropriate altitude	hand over the flight to the next sector for landing at Calgary Airport
clearing ACA3697 to FL290	the flight was placed at a higher risk of being involved in a loss-of-separation incident with opposite-direction traffic , with a resulting greater potential for a midair collision
the controller first had to ensure the appropriate lateral spacing with another westbound flight , ACA579 several miles to the north at FL310	descend ACA3697 to the required altitude before handoff to the Calgary arrival sector
his attention was focused on two of the five aircraft he was controlling	The controller did not adequately scan the radar display and detect the conflict between ACA3697 and CDR8510
it may not be evident on the radar display	This increases the risk that controllers will forget about a conflict
the controller had	the appropriate lateral spacing with another westbound flight , ACA579 several miles the north at FL310
the controller	a conflict with CDR8510
The controller 's attention was fixed on one separation problem to the exclusion of another	the risk of a midair collision
only a TCAS RA to the pilots of CDR8510	a much closer encounter between the two aircraft
This	the risk controllers will forget about a conflict because it may not be evident on the radar display
