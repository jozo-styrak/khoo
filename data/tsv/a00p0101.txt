Throughout the climb , normal checklist procedures did not result in the checklist sequence being resumed -LRB- at several opportunities -RRB- , situational awareness on the flight deck was not maintained , and events were not prioritized in accordance with SOPs	, the focus of this analysis will relate to four system components : checklists , training , passenger care , and cabin emergency equipment
The incompatible equipment on the occurrence aircraft went undetected because of the number of different oxygen equipment fittings available and the absence of a standard requiring commonality between portable oxygen equipment within an aircraft cabin	, there was a delay , although not serious , in supplying oxygen to the infant passenger
The After Take-off checklist was not completed after an interruption	, the air conditioning and the pressurization system were not reconfigured for flight after a bleeds-off take-off
Completing checklist tasks alone , without the participation of the other pilot , eliminates error tolerances	, situational awareness may not be assured
The crew did not declare an emergency	, the flight was deprived of beneficial services from air traffic control and , if required , the immediate assistance of airport emergency services and medical attention
the After Take-off checklist was not completed after an interruption	the pressurization equipment was not reconfigured for flight
the limitations of this memory and human vulnerability to distracting events	the likelihood of this item being omitted is relatively high .2 Reconfiguration was not completed during the after take-off check , upon climbing through 10 000 feet , or on reaching cruise altitude , times when checks should have alerted the crew to set up the pressurization as required
completion of this checklist did not correct the problem	further diagnosis was not successful until the travelling company pilot arrived on the flight deck
the crew had not encountered a similar situation	through experience or training , they likely lacked awareness of the limitations of the Auto Fail or Unscheduled Pressurization Change checklist
incorporating	redundancy -LRB- both pilots cross-checking items -RRB- and reducing ambiguity -LRB- requiring verbal responses stating the actual value or status of an item -RRB-
Checklists	Flight-Deck
adequate communication practices	a form of built-in action cross-check is by-passed , subjecting individuals to their own errors or omissions when completing tasks alone
having	two pilots
the crew did not declare an emergency	the flight was deprived of priority handling by air traffic control and medical services at Kelowna
the number of different oxygen equipment fittings available and the absence of a standard requiring commonality between portable oxygen equipment within an aircraft cabin	The incompatible equipment on the occurrence aircraft went undetected
a lack of passenger knowledge	The inflation of the passenger oxygen mask reservoir was a concern to many passengers
the cabin altitude warning horn	and depressurization
one oxygen bottle in the aircraft cabin were not compatible -LRB- interchangeable -RRB- with the other portable passenger oxygen bottles in the same cabin	Portable passenger oxygen masks
human vulnerability	events
The lack of timeliness in reconfiguring the pneumatic system	the assessment
This practice	a lower level of situational awareness when one crew member is removed from the operational loop
redundancy -LRB- both pilots cross-checking items -RRB-	ambiguity -LRB- requiring verbal responses stating the actual value or status of an item -RRB-
defences - consisting of but not limited to SOPs , dual pilots , training , and checklists - were in place	such an event developing
This	situational awareness not being assured among the crew , thereby losing the defence of redundancy by having two pilots
Crew resource management -LRB- CRM -RRB- practices help crew members communicate better	their interaction
Crew resource management -LRB- CRM -RRB- practices	crew members communicate better , which can affect their interaction and greatly enhance their situational awareness during all aspects of a flight
In this situation , failure to understand PA messages from the flight deck , when crew workload prevented the relay of messages through the flight attendants	confusion
crew workload	the relay of messages through the flight attendants
The shutdown	cabin depressurization
This	their regaining control of cabin pressurization
