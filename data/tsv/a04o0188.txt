the aircraft 's approach had positioned the aircraft at 50 feet above the threshold	with all other factors remaining the same , the aircraft have used 6625 feet to stop
the braking profile had matched that of previous flights	even with a threshold crossing height of 75 feet , the aircraft have required 6700 feet from threshold to full stop
The pilots were aware of the wet runway conditions and the approximate landing distance required	, they should have been aware of the requirement for a normal touchdown point on the 8000-foot runway , typically about 1000 feet from the threshold
what happened in the cockpit and , consequently , with the aircraft	reconstructing
preserving all evidence	including that provided by the CVR
an electrical , mechanical , or hydraulic brake problem existed at the time of the landing	It not be determined
The AFM factored landing field length of 6500 feet	a safety margin in the event of a problem or long landing
Several operational and human factors	the occurrence
a slower flap 45 approach	a shorter landing distance
in a shorter landing distance	the risk of hydroplaning
The influences	this were the turn to intercept the localizer at close range , the need to begin the final descent to land , and the realization that it would be difficult to slow the aircraft enough for the flap 45 approach
of the need for a firm landing	the risk of hydroplaning
the anti-skid system modulating brake pressure	wheel lockup
the anti-system	the brakes come into full effect and effectively slow the aircraft
into full effect	the aircraft
the CVR	that
Interference with the CVR obstructs the work of the investigation	the Board reporting publicly on causes and safety deficiencies
The approach to Runway 25 was high , fast , and not stabilized	the aircraft touching down almost halfway down the 8000-foot runway
this most likely	the aircraft hydroplaning on touchdown
The anti-skid system most likely	the brake pressures rising to normal values until 16 to 19 seconds after weight on wheels , resulting in little or no braking action immediately after landing
The anti-skid system most likely prevented the brake pressures from rising to normal values until 16 to 19 seconds after weight on wheels	little or no braking action
The flight crew were	to recognize and react to the lack of normal deceleration
This delayed the transfer of control to the captain	the runway overrun
This	the transfer of control the captain
