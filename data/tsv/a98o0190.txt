The distance to clear a 50-foot obstacle at the end of the runway would undoubtedly be more than with the flaps set to 25 degrees	was survivable , most probably because the impacts with the trees and the angles at which they were struck absorbed most of the aircraft 's momentum and because the passengers were wearing their restraints ; however , the fire that followed the impact led to the fatalities
the substantial fire damage	A complete examination of the aircraft was not possible
the first excursion down the runway was a take-off attempt , it is probable that the first attempt was conducted without any flaps extended and the second attempt with the flaps extended to 25 degrees , the manufacturer 's recommended flap extension for a soft-field take-off	Based on witness accounts and the fact that a pilot normally change some parameter of the aircraft configuration after experiencing a failed take-off attempt ,
the manner in which the flaps are operated and the lever locked in position	It was concluded that the flaps were set at 40 degrees during the last take-off attempt
the low speed and high drag , the aircraft stalled	In an attempt to clear the trees , the pilot probably raised the nose of the aircraft , but
the impacts with the trees and the angles at which they were struck absorbed most of the aircraft 's momentum and because the passengers were wearing their restraints	The impact was survivable , most probably
the passengers were wearing their restraints ; however , the fire that followed the impact led to the fatalities	The impact was survivable , most probably because the impacts with the trees and the angles at which they were struck absorbed most of the aircraft 's momentum and
the wind conditions and the local topography	the aircraft
a headwind	aircraft
the engine was	the required power
The runway surface conditions and the fully extended flaps	the take-off distance and the distance required to climb to an altitude to safely pass over the trees
the pilot in an attempt	the first excursion down the runway
the high drag	a loss of climb performance , which made it impossible for the aircraft to climb fast enough to clear the trees off the end of the runway
However , with the flaps fully extended , the high drag resulted in a loss of climb performance	it impossible for the aircraft to climb fast enough to clear the trees off the end of the runway
the fire that followed the impact	the fatalities
the area of the battery	arcing in the presence of gasoline vapours from the ruptured fuel
There was no indication of any pre-impact damage to the engine	it developing rated power
There was no indication of malfunction or component failure of the aircraft	the accident
no indication that incapacitation or physiological factors	the pilot 's performance
the pilot	the first excursion
