In this occurrence , a series of decisions made by the crew contributed to gradually increase the risk to which the flight was exposed until the aircraft was finally placed in a position where it was impossible to re-establish flight safety	, this analysis will focus on those decisions and how they were able to circumvent the defences in place to reduce the risk related to the operation
Moreover , the radar data indicated an altitude of 1700 feet at the runway threshold	more than likely that the flight crew of C-FMAI had to descend below the MDA to establish visual contact with the runway
flying a holding pattern at OMOLI	the flight crew members of C-FMAI believed that they were clear of the other aircraft
it executed a missed approach	However , the crew had not taken into consideration the path or the altitude that the other aircraft be flying
the aircraft flew the holding pattern to the northeast of OMOLI at a lower altitude than the missed approach altitude for Runway 23	the separation between both aircraft was no longer ensured , thereby increasing the risk of collision
the two aircraft were flying converging paths in cloud	This also increased the risk of collision
landing with a tailwind component on a wet runway	in addition to placing it on an opposing path to the other traffic approaching for Runway 23
the TAF received prior to departure indicated	the ceiling could lower temporarily to 200 feet
there was no approach briefing , contrary to company SOPs	The crew took few measures to control the threat represented by the weather , primarily
the aircraft was not on the ground before the taxiway	leaving approximately 1800 feet of runway , the pilot-in-command did not convey his action the co-pilot
the crew	a series of decisions
a series of decisions made by the crew	gradually increase the risk to which the flight was exposed until the aircraft was finally placed in a position where it was impossible to re-establish flight safety
the defences in place	the risk
they were	the defences in place
the pilot-in-command	proper separation with other aircraft
When the aircraft flew the holding pattern to the northeast of OMOLI at a lower altitude than the missed approach altitude for Runway 23 , the separation between both aircraft was no longer ensured	the risk of collision
This	the risk of collision
addition	it
That decision	the risk to which the flight was exposed by landing with a tailwind component on a wet runway , in addition to placing it on an opposing path to the other traffic approaching for Runway 23
The pilot-in-command did not see the runway environment until he was over the threshold at an altitude	considerably the landing distance available for a safe landing
the tailwind component and the wet surface	the landing roll distance
The decision to continue the landing	the aircraft to touch down when the remaining runway distance was insufficient for a safe landing
the aircraft	a runway excursion
The aircraft was positioned over the runway threshold at an altitude that did not allow a landing at the beginning of the runway , and this , combined with a tailwind component and the wet runway surface	a runway excursion
Failure to follow standard operating procedures and a lack of crew coordination contributed to confusion on landing	the crew aborting the landing and executing a missed approach
The regulatory requirement to conform to or avoid the traffic pattern formed by other aircraft is not explicit as to how the traffic pattern should be avoided , in terms of either altitude or distance	risks of collision
this situation	pilots operating in uncontrolled airspace to believe that they are avoiding another aircraft executing an instrument approach when in reality a risk of collision exists
