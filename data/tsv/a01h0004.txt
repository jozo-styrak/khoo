it looks like the intended object , is in the expected location , and does a similar job	Their actions were consistent with an error known as perceptual confusion2 which occurs when , during a highly routine task , one object is accepted as a match for the intended object
their intensity , the time of day , and the snow-covered background	Although the approach and runway lights were on , the lights would have been hard to see3
two reasons	The airport maintenance worker did not sweep Runway 22 prior to the arrival of CDR8321
increasing pilot awareness of the issue	by maintaining runway contrast , and by providing more compelling runway identification lighting
this difference was	the crew
The lateral displacement from Runway 22	a noticeable deflection of the VOR needle
Although the approach and runway lights were on , the lights would have been hard to see3 because of their intensity , the time of day , and the snow-covered background ; and , the runway was not equipped with RILS or ODALS	more compelling cues the aircraft was landing in the wrong place
sweeping the runway	it more slippery
requirement	a visual contrast between the runway environment and surrounding fields
His lack of training concerning the contents of the AOM	this lack of awareness
the lack of a requirement for such training	him not receiving it
The airport maintainer did not receive training concerning the contents of the AOM	him not being aware of the requirement to provide a means by which a visual contrast can be provided to delineate the runway environment from the fields surrounding it
training concerning the contents of the AOM , which likely contributed to him not being aware of the requirement	a means by which a visual contrast can be provided to delineate the runway environment from the fields surrounding it
a visual contrast	to delineate the runway environment from the fields surrounding it

The airport maintainer was concerned that sweeping the runway would make it more slippery	him not sweeping Runway 22 prior to the arrival of CDR8321
sweeping the runway	it more slippery
Runway 22 was snow-covered	the flight crew not distinguishing it from the surrounding snow-covered fields
RILS or ODALS	those
There were no compelling cues , such as those that could have been provided by RILS or ODALS , to alert the flight crew that they were not landing on Runway 22	them landing off the intended runway
