the aircraft entered the mountain pass at 2000 feet	it have required the aircraft to climb at a rate of 609 fpm to clear this elevation
the pilot was taking photos during this repositioning flight and whether	this have caused a distraction or contributed to perception errors and misjudgement of height above ground
the configuration and weight of the aircraft , the high density altitude , the performance of this modified aircraft , the close proximity to the terrain when the pilot reversed course , and the downdraughts	the aircraft was not able to clear the surrounding terrain
increased	drag from the equipment , density altitude , down-flowing winds , and manoeuvring resulted in the aircraft colliding with terrain during the turn
Placards are not required	, pilots and observers approved to board may be unaware of the limitations of the aircraft and the associated risks
the post-crash	fire
This	the investigation and this analysis focus on operational issues
The absence of flight plan information regarding these devices	search and rescue efforts
No mechanical malfunction was recorded or found before the commencement of this flight or during examination	engine power loss or a loss of flight control
the relatively high weight , its configuration and modifications , and the high density altitude	performance
downdraughts	the aircraft 's climb performance
this	a distraction
this	the greatest height above ground
the aircraft toward the sunlit right-side hill slope	the area for a left turn between the hills
the pilot was	its descent
the aircraft was	the surrounding terrain
sufficient terrain clearance	the aircraft 's performance
with the effects of increased drag from the equipment , density altitude , down-flowing winds , and manoeuvring	the aircraft colliding with terrain during the turn
The absence of flight plan information regarding these devices	search and rescue efforts
The TC approval process	the continued operation of this modified aircraft for sustained environmental research missions under a flight permit authority
