of the failure of the abrasion strip bond was not determined	All applicable AWDs had been complied with
the weight of the bonding strip	the tail rotor blades were out of balance
rapid , low cycle , fatigue cracking	The tail rotor transmission retaining studs had fractured
The bonding and rivets securing the abrasion strip to one tail rotor blade released	the abrasion strip to separate from the blade
this imbalance	the severe vibration
The abrasion strip on one tail rotor blade failed adhesively , and the retaining rivets pulled free	the abrasion strip separate from the blade
The loss of the strip caused a tail rotor blade imbalance	separation of the tail rotor transmission assembly from the helicopter
The loss of the strip	a tail rotor blade imbalance which resulted in separation of the tail rotor transmission assembly from the helicopter
