There are no performance charts available for the B727 to accurately determine a landing distance for the runway conditions that were present during the incident landing	, it could not be determined if a successful landing would have been possible if the flight crew had used a more aggressive landing/stopping technique
the flight crew made their decision to continue with the landing	their assessment of the suitability of the runway was based on incomplete and inaccurate information
the Moncton ACC controller passed the braking action reports to the flight crew 26 minutes before the occurrence	he did not provide the landing times for the DC-9 and the B737
having	them monitor a report directly from the maintenance foreman who was working on the runway
A review of the tower tape shows that it is unlikely that the flight crew would have realized that they had missed or misunderstood some of the transmission	, they would not have had reason to ask for the information to be repeated
taking engines one and three out of full reverse at 70 knots	the flight crew used more runway to stop than they would have had they used all available deceleration devices to their maximum limits
a successful	landing have been possible if the flight crew had used a more aggressive landing/stopping technique
having such a procedure as an out	flight crews could be influenced to attempt landings on runways of questionable suitability
the FDR was old and there was a lack of facilities to read it , and because there was no CVR data available	Information was lost to the investigation
No mechanical discrepancies were found with the aircraft	the occurrence
the flight crew	their decision to continue with the landing
their assessment of the suitability of the runway	incomplete and inaccurate information
poor communications	this occurrence
Even though these aircraft had landed three to four hours earlier , their assessment of the braking action should have been more applicable to the incident crew than the assessments of aircraft that landed later	their similarity to the incident aircraft size and weight
The low-key manner in which the information from these two aircraft was passed to the flight crew	their dismissing the information as not applicable , so much so that , after the occurrence , they did not even remember these aircraft being mentioned by the controller
the Convair 580 flight crew	either the actual runway conditions or the intent of the message the tower controller
their test of the braking action	any significant delay in applying reverse thrust
flight crews	to attempt landings on runways of questionable suitability
Incomplete and non-standard communications	vital information on the runway condition reaching the flight crew
to them	an accurate assessment of the runway conditions
sufficient information for flight crews	landing distances on contaminated runways
