These conditions are known to have existed at the approximate time and location of the accident	probable that the pilot encountered whiteout conditions and was unable to accurately judge , through visual reference , his altitude above the surface of the lake
The wreckage pattern and the damage characteristics indicate that the aircraft struck the ground in a steep , left bank and a shallow , nose-down attitude , with the landing gear and flaps retracted	appears that the aircraft was operating at cruise speed in cruise configuration when it struck the surface of Fox Lake
the recommended cruising speed	the time en route from take-off to the accident site was approximately 15 to 20 minutes
there was no communication with any agency or other aircraft after the first eight minutes of flight	the pilot 's actions for the duration of the flight could not be determined
snow showers and the flat , snow-covered surface of Fox Lake	Reduced visibility

he initiated a turn to escape the deteriorating weather	In the absence of a visible horizon , the pilot also have succumbed to spatial disorientation , -LRB- 4 -RRB- particularly
whiteout and spatial	disorientation
whiteout conditions degraded his ability to see the aircraft 's altitude and orientation	The pilot flew the aircraft into the frozen surface of Fox Lake , probably
Reduced visibility due to snow showers and the flat , snow-covered surface of Fox Lake	a uniformly white environment devoid of the visual contrasts that are essential for accurate depth perception
The pilot 's lack of instrument training and experience	him more susceptible to the effects of whiteout and spatial disorientation
The flat , snow-covered surface of Fox Lake and the presence of snow showers at the approximate time and location of the accident	conditions
