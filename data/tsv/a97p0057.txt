It is likely that he was distracted by the aircraft departing from Boundary Bay , and in particular by the second Canadian Regional flight , which was encountering bad weather and which needed to be re-routed	, it is likely that his attention became channelized and he did not recognize the developing conflict between CDR 1255 and REGS 33
this happens	they may not assimilate all the information from the data strips
The departure controller ,	an arriving aircraft that was traversing the departure sector at an altitude much lower than the standard of 8,000 feet asl , thought that he was dealing with a type of aircraft that had an airspeed comparable to that of the departing flight CDR 1255 -LRB- about 160 knots -RRB-
the two aircraft had been cleared to the same altitude with the expectation that their tracks would not intercept with less than the minimum radar separation	the controller did not recognize the impending conflict in time to prevent the loss of separation
they	a certain type and speed of aircraft the particular call sign they
Frequent exposure to TC inspection flights	some controllers associate the generic REGS call sign with smaller , slower aircraft
Frequent exposure to TC inspection flights leads some controllers	the generic REGS call sign smaller , slower aircraft
the aircraft departing from Boundary Bay	he
the impending conflict in time	the loss of separation
he	REGS 33 slower , smaller aircraft
The departure controller 's airspace separation plan was	his expectation both aircraft would operate at about the same airspeed , as he associated REGS 33 with slower , smaller aircraft
An aircraft that had departed from Boundary Bay and the routing of another aircraft around an area of bad weather are likely to have distracted the departure controller	him to channelize his attention , and to miss the developing conflict between the two occurrence aircraft
