The analysis will therefore focus on the pilot 's applied IFR/night take-off technique , the role and influence of the quasi co-pilot , the communications between Airco Aircraft Charters and Northern Sky Aviation , the Airco dispatcher 's request to change the flight plan	of the overweight condition of the aircraft on the departure
flying the aircraft with reference to the altimeter , VSI , attitude indicator airspeed indicator	which , in this case , would likely have allowed the pilot to detect that the aircraft was not established in a climb
he was aware that the aircraft was at or above the approved take-off weight	The pilot may have intended to reach the blue line speed of 107 KIAS soon after take-off
he was not delegated flight crew responsibilities , his participation during the flight created a situation of crew resource mismanagement	Because he was not familiar to the captain and
weight was	a concern he remain in Rainbow Lake and thereby reduce the take-off weight by approximately 170 pounds
he had not previously flown a Northern Sky trip he was unfamiliar with the routine of the Northern Sky daily flights	He was relatively inexperienced on Piper PA-31-350 aircraft , having flown less than 100 hours on the type , and
no evidence that weather or a mechanical discrepancy	the accident
on the aircraft instruments to maintain airspeed and attitude	any false sensations of a climb
the false-climb illusion	scan while
Pilots can overcome false sensations by flying the aircraft with reference to the altimeter , VSI , attitude indicator , and airspeed indicator , which , in this case	the pilot to detect that the aircraft was not established in a climb
Pilots	false sensations by flying the aircraft with reference to the altimeter , VSI , attitude indicator , and airspeed indicator , which , in this case , would likely have allowed the pilot to detect that the aircraft was not established in a climb

The co-pilot 's apparent well-intentioned advice on the frost heave near the threshold of runway 09	the captain 's decision to take-off on runway 27 , which was uphill toward rising terrain and with no lights visible after departure
