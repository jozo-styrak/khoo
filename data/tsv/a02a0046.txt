Debris being thrown from the jet blast or propeller wash from other aircraft while on the ground could also cause surface chip gouges , although it is likely that this scenario would cause damage over a larger area	, it appears that at some time during the aircraft 's operating history , a take-off was conducted from a runway surface that had excessive debris on it , and this debris was blown against the windows by the right-hand propeller , causing the surface chip gouges
of the window failure could not be determined	Consequently , it appears that at some time during the aircraft 's operating history , a take-off was conducted from a runway surface that had excessive debris on it , and this debris was blown against the windows by the right-hand propeller , causing the surface chip gouges
However , these fragments and the adjacent windows had surface chip gouges in excess of the recommended tolerance and some of the gouges had crack vents protruding internally	, it is probable that a cracking failure occurred due to the excessively damaged condition of the exterior surface of the window
the excessively damaged condition of the exterior surface of the window	Therefore , it is probable that a cracking failure occurred
the first indication of the rapid depressurization	the captain , who was the pilot flying , should have initiated an emergency descent while the first officer donned his oxygen mask
an excessively damaged condition of the exterior surface of the window	It is probable that a cracking failure occurred
