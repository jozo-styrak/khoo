Examination of the wreckage and a detailed examination of various components revealed no evidence of a loss of power	, the investigation did not determine the cause of the transient decrease in rpm reported by the pilot
Since their mechanical strength was reduced to about 26 per cent of their original strength , the lower shoulder straps failed before reaching the prescribed limit	, the pilot was subjected to greater deceleration forces than he should have sustained in the accident
However , since no signs of physical wear were found , the belts were considered to be in good condition on the aircraft maintenance and TC inspections	It appears that the absence of specific evaluation criteria with regard to the ultraviolet degradation of the belts contributed to the return to service of seat belts that no longer met regulatory requirements
it was rolled up on the inertia reel , was practically not faded	The upper part of the shoulder straps , which was less exposed to sunlight
no signs of physical wear were found	the belts were considered to be in good condition on the aircraft maintenance and TC inspections
degradation of the straps caused by prolonged exposure to sunlight	The failure occurred
The aircraft 's engine was	power at the time of the collision with the surface of the water
Examination of the wreckage and a detailed examination of various components	no evidence of a loss of power
A precautionary landing or autorotation landing	the horizontal impact forces
ultraviolet rays from the sun	whitening of the lower shoulder straps
the absence of specific evaluation criteria with regard to the ultraviolet degradation of the belts	the return to service of seat belts that no longer met regulatory requirements
prolonged exposure to sunlight	a result of degradation of the straps
