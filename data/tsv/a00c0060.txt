Airframe parts that had been exposed to forward airflow were considered to have been preserved at below-freezing temperatures after the accident , and no airframe ice was noted	, it is unlikely that airframe icing had accreted on the aircraft at the time of the accident
the substandard bungees	the rigging of the skis
oscillation or vibration had occurred	it have contributed to the aircraft 's descent , in combination with weather-related turbulence
the engine was	a considerable amount of power
engine	power
the accident aircraft encountered turbulence of sufficient strength	the aircraft 's descent
The fatigue cracking found in the right ski link had	that link
the condition of the bungees	ski oscillation or vibration
it	the aircraft 's descent , in combination with weather-related turbulence
air turbulence of sufficient strength	the aircraft 's descent
The forward rigging bungees for both skis had less than the required stretching resistance	oscillation or vibration of either or both skis
