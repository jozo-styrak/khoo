If the oleo strut had been off-centre once airborne , the system 's logic would have prevented retraction of the landing gear	conceivable that the oleo strut was operating normally during the take-off from Bonaventure and that it collapsed in flight
The investigation could not determine that this nut had backed off during the occurrence	, it is possible that the nitrogen leaked gradually
The oleo pneumatic shock absorber -LRB- oleo strut -RRB- was found to be compressed due to a loss of nitrogen	, the nose landing gear was released from the landing gear uplock latch , which allowed the wheel assembly to pivot and become jammed in the well
the centring cam was no longer engaged in the compressed oleo strut , thereby resulting in the wheel/deflector assembly not having sufficient clearance for the landing gear to extend normally	Some nose wheel rotation was also permitted in this unsecured position
the oleo strut does not extend	the clearance between the gravel deflectors and the nose landing gear
the oleo strut operates correctly	the clearance available is sufficient for the landing gear to deploy as designed
the oleo strut had been off-centre once airborne	the system 's logic have prevented retraction of the landing gear
the landing gear had already exited the uplock latch and was mechanically jammed in the nose wheel well	the use of the manual release handle in this case was ineffective
gravel deflectors	the clearance between the tires and the nose landing gear well structure is clearly greater
a loss of nitrogen	The oleo pneumatic shock absorber -LRB- oleo strut -RRB- was found to be compressed
The compression of the oleo strut	the landing gear migrate out of the uplock latch and fall on to the nose landing gear doors
Some nose wheel rotation was also permitted in this unsecured position because the centring cam was no longer engaged in the compressed oleo strut	the wheel/deflector assembly not having sufficient clearance for the landing gear to extend normally
The rotation of the nose gear in the well	the right-side gravel deflector becoming stuck
The rotation of the nose gear in the well resulted in the right-side gravel deflector becoming stuck	extension of the nose landing gear
a kit	it operate on unpaved/gravel runways
the system 's logic	retraction of the landing gear
pin	movement rearward and ensures that the nose gear is released and comes into contact with the wheel doors
this aircraft on different types of unpaved/gravel runways and under exceptional operating conditions	it vulnerable to damage
As a result , the nose landing gear was released from the landing gear uplock latch	the wheel assembly to pivot
The right deflector remained jammed in the nose landing gear well	extension of the landing gear
pin	the landing gear be released from the landing gear uplock latch and to drop into the well during flight , causing the right gravel deflectors to jam , preventing extension of the nose landing gear
The design of the landing gear latch and pin allows the landing gear to be released from the landing gear uplock latch and to drop into the well during flight	the right gravel deflectors jam
pin allows the landing gear to be released from the landing gear uplock latch and to drop into the well during flight , causing the right gravel deflectors to jam	extension of the nose landing gear
Another oleo pneumatic shock absorber -LRB- oleo strut -RRB- compression	the same situation occurring again
