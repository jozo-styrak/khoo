for the engine power loss , or roll-back , was a loss of vacuum of the fuel control unit -LRB- FCU -RRB- acceleration bellows , which resulted in the FCU reducing fuel going to the engine to minimum flow	For this occurrence there was an area available for a forced landing and the aircraft was landed without damage , and with no injuries to the five passengers on board
The FCU Light Overhaul carried out three months prior to the occurrence did not call for the inspection of the acceleration bellows and this was not done	, the acceleration bellows had not been inspected for nearly 15 years
The FCU light overhaul procedure did not provide enough direction as to when the procedure may be used	those using the light overhaul procedure may not detect , in sub-components such as the acceleration bellows , flaws that can be beyond safe limits
a breach of the bellows material at a corrosion site , at a time when the compressor discharge air was at its highest pressure -- under take-off power conditions	The loss of the bellows vacuum was
the presence of high-temperature , high-pressure compressor discharge air in the chamber housing the acceleration bellows	The operating environment of the FCU bellows is corrosive
these full inspection intervals are not always mandatory	However ,
the fuel control unit -LRB- FCU -RRB- bellows was breached , causing the fuel flow to the engine to be limited to minimum flow	The engine power loss occurred
corrosion , initiated during in-service use and exacerbated by long-term , un-preserved storage	The FCU bellows was breached
a complete inspection of the FCU components was not carried out during overhaul	The corrosion was not detected
an absence of operating and storage history of such components	Overhaul scheduling for engine accessories such as FCUs is difficult to calculate
the light overhaul provisions are contained within the same Service Manual used for the full overhaul of the FCU	The FAA Airworthiness Approval Tag -LRB- FAA Form 8130-3 -RRB- description of the FCU overhaul did not indicate that the FCU underwent less than a full overhaul , occurring , in part ,
The reason for the engine power loss , or roll-back , was a loss of vacuum of the fuel control unit -LRB- FCU -RRB- acceleration bellows	the FCU
in the FCU	fuel going to the engine to minimum flow
the FCU acceleration bellows control function	engine operation
Careful inspection of the bellows at the 8-year point would likely detect areas where corrosion was developing	its replacement during overhaul at the recommended interval
However , because these full inspection intervals are not always mandatory , and component maintenance records may be lacking , defective FCU bellows can be in service	the potential for power loss at critical stages of flight
those carrying out maintenance activities	the opportunity to better evaluate the serviceability of an FCU
The engine power loss occurred because the fuel control unit -LRB- FCU -RRB- bellows was breached	the fuel flow the engine to be limited to minimum flow
long-term , un-preserved storage	in-service use
This option	restoration of sufficient engine power continue flight for instances where the FCU acceleration bellows is breached or other compressor discharge air problems occur
