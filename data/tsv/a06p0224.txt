There was no indication of any pre-accident flight control or rotor drive system malfunction on the helicopter that would have contributed to a loss of control	, this analysis will focus on the flight performance available from the helicopter , the environmental conditions , and the effects of the Air Comm Corporation heater operating limitations
From a vertical performance perspective , this is the hardest condition to satisfy	, the helicopter aerodynamic performance did not contribute to the circumstances of this accident
there were layered bands of fog in the area ; it was raining and the air was saturated ; the terrain was steep and the gorge narrow ; the touchdown zone was confined with little room to manoeuvre ; the landing surface was remarkably off-level and consisted of loose rock and debris ; the surface required a hover exit -LRB- toe-in -RRB- procedure ; the wind was moderate and continually shifting , likely with a downflowing component ; the waterfall adjacent to the site was flowing rapidly ; and the RFM required the cabin heater to be turned off	of the rain , the temperature , and the terrain , the air was saturated and conducive to rapidly changing zones of reduced visibility
Therefore , this analysis will focus on the flight performance available from the helicopter , the environmental conditions	of the Air Comm Corporation heater operating limitations
the rain , the temperature the terrain	the air was saturated and conducive to rapidly changing zones of reduced visibility
This condition rapidly degenerated into a loss of control and led to the rollover	with the terrain
the engine limitations remain the same	This bonus performance is purposely not utilized
the pilot 's condition from deteriorating and in establishing a stable and safe shelter for them all	preventing
There was no indication of any pre-accident flight control or rotor drive system malfunction on the helicopter	a loss of control
the helicopter aerodynamic performance did	the circumstances of this accident
this environment	it difficult for the pilot to maintain visual reference with the terrain
Exacerbating this condition was the rapid waterfall in the pilot 's peripheral vision	vision illusion and disorientation
This condition degenerated into a loss of control	the rollover and heavy impact with the terrain
the sudden loss of the passenger from the left skid	the already challenging task for the pilot of countering this weight on the skid in a deteriorating visual climate
he was	visual hover reference with the terrain
The heater and demister system installed in this helicopter was effective in controlling the interior condensation	the pilot clear vision through the windshield and side windows
the C20 hybrid engine	more than its rated 400 shp
Presently , there is no relief from the RFM limitation for Canadian operators of the Bell 206	a pilot to assess each individual operational situation and select the heater and demister as appropriate
The full seat restraints , as well as the pilot 's flight helmet	more serious injuries
The full seat restraints , as well as the pilot 's flight helmet , helped	more serious injuries
The quick reaction by the front seat passenger in securing the engine , fuel , and electrical services	a post-crash fire
This review also certainly benefited the notification and response of SAR forces	the timely location and recovery of the survivors
The selected touchdown area was significantly sloped and the surface consisted of loose rock and debris	the skids slip rearwards when the rear passenger climbed onto the left skid
Saturated air , low temperature , rain , and mist from the waterfall	significant water droplet accumulation on the outside surfaces of the helicopter windshields
The air in the cockpit quickly became saturated when the first passenger entered the cockpit	the rapid formation of heavy condensation on the inside surfaces of the helicopter windshields and front door windows
this affected the pilot 's external visibility	him to lose hover reference
this	the pilot 's external visibility
the pilot was	the helicopter
windshield condensation	a pilot 's ability to clearly see outside the helicopter
The pilot 's helmet and seat restraints and the front passenger seat restraints	more serious injury the pilot and passenger
The formal review at the start of the operations at Knight Inlet benefited the notification and response of search and rescue forces	the timely location and recovery of the survivors
The front seat passenger 's quick cockpit reactions to secure the helicopter likely	post-impact fire
Both passengers effectively used their training in first aid and forest survival	the pilot 's condition deteriorating
