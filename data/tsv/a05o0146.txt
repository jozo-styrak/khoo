the auxiliary pump was selected off	the engine
electrical wiring to the resistor block in the auxiliary fuel pump system was corroded and the contact poor , the pump operation was intermittent when the pilot re-selected the pump on	it did not operate
the pilot re-selected the pump to provide additional fuel pressure to the engine	it did not operate
The additional fuel pressure from the auxiliary fuel pump	engine power
The piece of foreign material lodged between the ball and the seat within the bypass valve of the EDP	inadequate fuel pressure for normal engine operation
A piece of thread sealant lodged in the bypass valve of the engine-driven fuel pump created a reduction of fuel pressure	normal engine operation
A piece of thread sealant lodged in the bypass valve of the engine-driven fuel pump	a reduction of fuel pressure
A poor electrical connection within the auxiliary fuel pump	intermittent operation of the pump
pump	additional fuel pressure the engine
