the cold front passage	their flight
the flight crew contacted any of these stations	the most recent weather report that have been provided before their approach was issued at 1628 and indicated that the surface wind was 200 M at 10 knots , and was therefore favouring Runway 27
they assessed that the conditions were becoming unsafe	The decision to make a second approach was consistent with normal industry practice , in that the crew continue with the intent to land while maintaining the option to break off the approach
the decision to abort the landing was made	there was insufficient distance remaining for the aircraft to accelerate to lift-off speed
the high groundspeed	A perception of sufficient airspeed

There were no anomalies found with the aircraft	this accident
the obstacles and terrain contour beyond the overrun area	the severity of injuries and the damage to the aircraft
crew	them to abandon their stop at Powell River or to change runways
decision	a second approach
The downwind condition on approach	the aircraft landing long and with a high ground speed , therefore increasing the landing distance
The downwind condition on approach contributed to the aircraft landing long and with a high ground speed	the landing distance
This , in combination with the hydroplaning	the crew stopping the aircraft in the runway length remaining

Alert Service Bulletin A25-1124A -LRB- dated 01 June 2000 -RRB- , which recommended replacing the inertia reel aluminum shaft with a steel shaft , was not completed	the risk of failure increasing over time
decision	a second approach
