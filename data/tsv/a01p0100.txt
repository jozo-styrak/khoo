Nothing was found to indicate that any mechanical malfunction initiated or contributed to the accident sequence , and there was usable fuel on board	, this analysis focuses on the operational aspects of the flight
the conditions were conducive to carburettor icing	this accident , except
rotor divergence and high-energy rotor/fuselage contact is not consistent with the known facts	mishandling of the cyclic control is not likely part of this scenario
the conditions were	icing
However , the wreckage and site signatures , light bulb analysis , and the position of the carburettor heat control -LRB- cold -RRB- suggests two plausible scenarios	the final circumstances of this accident

Rotor rpm decayed , for reasons that could not be determined	the main-rotor blades
The carburettor heat was OFF	the likelihood carburettor ice adversely affected engine performance
