Nevertheless , a series of decisions made by the flight crew contributed to the accident	, this analysis will focus on those decisions and how they circumvented the precautions put in place to reduce operating risks
Nothing required it to be	The crew was able to obtain authorization for a flight under instrument flight rules to this destination without being aware that the runway edge lights were out of order
The positions of the PAPI and the approach lights were clearly indicated , and there was no reason to think that there were approach lights for Runway 05R	, there is reason to believe that the crew members were not sufficiently familiar with the information shown on the approach chart , and that is why they asked the dispatcher about the position of the PAPI
Contrary to regulations , the flight crew did not give a safety briefing to the passengers	, the passengers were not well prepared to assume their responsibilities in case of an emergency , which reduced their probability of survival
According to the Canadian foreign air operator certificate , the flight crew was required to comply with ICAO standards	with the CAR applicable provisions
dealing with threats , errors and undesirable conditions	The coordination of a crew and the SOPs are the most easily available defence tools
the crew members had known about the NOTAM before departure	they have had additional information on which to base their flight decisions
The captain was able to activate some runway lighting components	, it is possible that he was confident that he would eventually be able to perceive the runway
the weather conditions	The fuel on board
referring	to the course deviation indicator -LRB- CDI -RRB- and the approach lights
Since neither pilot noticed the deviation on the CDI , it may be assumed that both pilots were focusing their attention outside , probably	locate the runway
the surface was covered with less than three centimetres	The runway had not been cleared of snow in the hours preceding the accident
Even if the crew had used the landing performance diagram in the flight manual , the diagram made no reference to a snow-covered runway	, it was impossible for the flight crew to ensure that the runway was long enough for a safe landing on a snow-covered surface
the co-pilot realized that neither he nor the captain had the runway in sight	he could have asked for a go-around
the absence of a briefing	the two passengers seated on the side seat were unaware of the existence of shoulder straps , which were hidden behind the seat
they were not wearing the shoulder straps	their protection in case of an accident was greatly reduced
structural damage , which delayed the evacuation and could have had serious consequences	The emergency exit could not be opened
the main door or the emergency exit	which could have delayed the evacuation , with serious consequences
they had not been given a safety briefing	the passengers seated in the side seats did not know that they should have worn shoulder straps and did not wear them , so they were not properly protected
precaution	such accidents
Closing the runway for night use would have provided an additional precaution	prevent night landings without runway edge lights
the runway for night use	an additional precaution that would have helped prevent night landings without runway edge lights
the flight crew	a series of decisions
a series of decisions made by the flight crew	the accident
the precautions put in place	risks
The crew was	authorization for a flight under instrument flight rules to this destination
The SOP manual	the pilot-in-command the prerogative of postponing or cancelling the flight if he deemed that it was not safe to undertake it
The captain was	some runway lighting components
he	the runway
the snow-covered runway	little contrast the adjacent terrain
The fuel on board and the weather conditions	it possible to do so
the airport chart and the approach chart to which they referred	all the information they
the diagram	no reference a snow-covered runway
Consequently , the passengers were not well prepared to assume their responsibilities in case of an emergency	their probability of survival
The emergency exit could not be opened due to structural damage	the evacuation
Poor flight planning , non-compliance with regulations and SOPs , and the lack of communications between the two pilots reveal a lack of airmanship on the part of the crew	the accident
Poor flight planning , non-compliance with regulations and SOPs , and the lack of communications between the two pilots	a lack of airmanship on the part of the crew , which contributed to the accident
Poor flight planning , non-compliance with regulations and standard operating procedures -LRB- SOPs -RRB- , and the lack of communications between the two pilots reveal a lack of airmanship on the part of the crew	the accident
with regulations and standard operating procedures -LRB- SOPs -RRB- , and the lack of communications between the two pilots	a lack of airmanship on the part of the crew , which contributed to the accident
Because they had not been given a safety briefing , the passengers were not familiar with the use of the main door or the emergency exit	the evacuation
they	a safety briefing
The armrest of the side seat had not been removed as required and was blocking access to the emergency exit	the evacuation
they	a safety briefing
The possibility of flying to an airport that does not meet the standards for night use	pilots the opportunity to attempt to land there , which in itself increases the risk of an accident
in itself	the risk of an accident
