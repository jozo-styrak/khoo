Without previous experience or other information to alert them to the potential of a black-hole illusion on approach , the crew were not adequately prepared to operate in this higher risk environment	the crew , in the absence of these defences , were unable to detect their proximity to the terrain until just before the aircraft struck the trees
This manner resulted in high descent and intermediate approach speeds and delayed the pre-landing checks and the configuration of the aircraft for landing	, the co-pilot 's attention was diverted inside the cockpit when approach monitoring was required
The crew did not adhere to the required standard operating procedures for the preparation and execution of the approach	, the crew were inadequately prepared for the visual conditions on final approach
previous experience or other information to alert them to the potential of a black-hole illusion on approach	the crew were not adequately prepared to operate in this higher risk environment
the potential for an asymmetric flap or landing gear malfunction due to the damage to control surfaces and the landing gear	Under normal operating circumstances , this decision would have been appropriate ; however , the decision created additional risk to safety
the damage to control surfaces and the landing gear	Under normal operating circumstances , this decision would have been appropriate ; however , the decision created additional risk to safety because of the potential for an asymmetric flap or landing gear malfunction
the runway length at Fox Harbour was sufficient for the flight to operate under either section	this did not affect the outcome of the occurrence
In this situation , the crew did not recognize the potential hazard of the black-hole illusion	did not compensate for it
complete aerodrome information , a comprehensive approach briefing , altitude call-outs , final approach monitoring , and adherence to SOPs	defences
visual conditions were	a black-hole illusion
Consequently the crew , in the absence of these defences	their proximity to the terrain until just
This manner	high descent and intermediate approach speeds
This manner resulted in high descent and intermediate approach speeds	the pre-landing checks and the configuration of the aircraft for landing
the decision	additional risk safety because of the potential for an asymmetric flap or landing gear malfunction due to the damage to control surfaces and the landing gear
Conditions	black-hole illusion
The high descent and intermediate approach speeds	cockpit pre-landing checks
This delay	the co-pilot 's attention being diverted inside the cockpit when approach monitoring should have been done
The crew 's decision to raise the landing gear and the flaps on the overshoot after hitting the trees	the risk the flight
