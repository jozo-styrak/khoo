The 25-hour inspection , as mandated by AD2001-24-51 , required the use of a borescope	inspect the upper fittings
Fatigue cracking of the upper right attach fitting occurred	the transfer of loads to the aft ring structure
The resulting onset of fatigue in the locknut flexible beam elements of the upper left attach fitting , which compromised the strength of the fastener	the upper left bolt pull out of the locknut
The resulting onset of fatigue in the locknut flexible beam elements of the upper left attach fitting	the strength of the fastener
Failure of the two upper attach fittings	overload and separation of the lower two attach fittings
This	the detachment of the tail boom and loss of aircraft control
This was later augmented by the AMOC	the operator to conduct visual inspections of the tail boom attach fittings
debris around the fitting	the crack in the fitting
the adjacent aft ring structure	the cascading failure of the remaining three tail boom
the Alternate Method of Compliance -LRB- AMOC -RRB-	inspections
