Furthermore , this crew had not practiced the go-around after touchdown manoeuvre during simulator training	, they were never exposed to either scenario and never had the opportunity to learn to retract the spoilers when conducting a go-around
the crew members had heard the warning horn during touch-and-go training in the past and did not recognize it as a warning and that they expected it to stop sounding once the aircraft was reconfigured , or simply that they were too busy to hear it	When the take-off configuration warning horn sounded , the crew did not immediately recognize that the spoilers were not stowed
standing water on the runway	The decision of the captain to carry out a go-around was based on the concern that insufficient Runway remained to bring the aircraft to a stop , especially with the potential
the transfer of control	The complexity level of the manoeuvre was also increased
the take-off configuration warning horn sounded	the crew did not immediately recognize that the spoilers were not stowed
procedures to ensure that the spoilers are retracted in the event of a go-around after touchdown	crews may leave the speedbrake lever in the extended position , increasing the risk of the aircraft not being able to meet the required climb gradient
The crew had not received any training for a bounced landing or a go-around after touchdown	did not retract the spoilers
the rate of descent at the time of touchdown	a hard landing and bounce
This	added drag that precluded a safe lift-off and caused the tail and the number 2 engine to strike the ground
a safe lift-off	the tail and the number 2 engine
The decision of the captain to carry out a go-around	the concern insufficient Runway remained to bring the aircraft to a stop , especially with the potential for standing water on the runway
this	the crew not stowing the spoilers
Without procedures to ensure that the spoilers are retracted in the event of a go-around after touchdown , crews may leave the speedbrake lever in the extended position	the risk of the aircraft
the risk of the aircraft being	the required climb gradient
