the accumulations reached moderate proportions	the pilot requested a lower altitude to leave the icing area and to enter warmer air to reduce the accumulations on the airframe
a lack of situational awareness	The first approach was unsuccessful
an operating ADF	the pilot was unaware of the aircraft 's exact position relative to the airport
some ice had shed from the antennas	During the second approach , the ADF functioned properly , probably
the seats became detached from the cabin floor	the passengers were no longer secured and were exposed to a high risk of injuries
his seatbelts were attached to the airframe and not the seat	The pilot remained in position
ice on the wings	The aircraft was unable to maintain altitude
fuel exhaustion	The right engine lost power
warmer air	the accumulations on the airframe
The prolonged exposure to the icing conditions increased the amount of ice on the aircraft	its lifting capability
The prolonged exposure to the icing conditions	the amount of ice on the aircraft
The low amount of fuel , in combination with the lateral movement of the aircraft , most likely caused the right main fuel tank port to become exposed to air	the power loss on the right engine
the use of the cabin heater for the duration of the round-trip flight	the lower quantity of fuel in the main tanks , particularly in the right main tank
The elasticity of the carpet and underlay	the detachment of the passenger seats from the airframe
The pilot 's facial injuries resulted from a loose shoulder strap	his head to hit the glare shield
The aircraft was	altitude because of ice on the wings
the aircraft cabin floor	the passenger seats detaching from the cabin floor
