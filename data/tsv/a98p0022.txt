At that time , the helicopter could not lift off the ground ; the accident pilot experienced the same circumstance just before the accident	, the possibility of mechanical malfunction of one or more of the engine control components being a contributing factor in the loss of rotor rpm can not be discounted
The ice that the pilot found on the main rotor blades had accumulated on the rotor disk hub which has no aerodynamic benefit and produces little lift , if any	, it is unlikely that removing the ice from the blades ' roots had any significant effect on the aerodynamic efficiency of the rotor system , and certainly would not have been the principal factor for the rotor rpm recovering before the final take-off
The pilot experienced a sudden decay of main rotor rpm at an altitude , airspeed , and power demand combination that did not permit him to effectively recover the rpm and continue flight	, he was committed to perform a forced landing on a downward-sloping surface
As a result , he was committed to perform a forced landing on a downward-sloping surface	forces were not great enough to activate the armed ELT
engine surging	Nonetheless , previous logbook entries record the removal and replacement of primary engine control components
that time	the helicopter could not lift off the ground
loss of rotor rpm can not be discounted	the
instance of rotor rpm decay	either
an accumulation of snow or ice in the engine intake had occurred	or if such an accumulation have led to an engine performance degradation sufficient to precipitate a loss of rotor rpm under the specific take-off conditions prevailing at the time of the accident
instance of rotor rpm decay is the pilot 's handling technique	the second
handling error	Such circumstances would have been demanding for the pilot , would have had incrementally deleterious effects on helicopter performance , and would have allowed little margin
engine surging	The engine logbook records the removal and replacement of primary engine control components
loss of rotor rpm can not be discounted	the
snow or ice had accumulated in the engine intake	It not be determined
main rotor rpm decayed	the combination of altitude , airspeed , and power demand did not permit the pilot to effectively regain the rpm and continue flight
Despite rigorous testing and examination of the engine and its ancillary systems , no defects were found	the sudden and uncommanded loss of main rotor rpm
a combination of performance tolerance extremes of the engine fuel control system components	the original surging problems
no aerodynamic benefit	little lift
to accumulate sufficient blade ice	significant and rapid rotor rpm decay
post-accident information	no ice accumulation on the main rotor blades
such an accumulation	an engine performance degradation sufficient to precipitate a loss of rotor rpm under the specific take-off conditions prevailing at the time of the accident
an engine performance degradation	a loss of rotor rpm under the specific take-off conditions prevailing at the time of the accident
Prior to the loss of rotor rpm , the helicopter was climbing with high power , and at a weight and density altitude	the helicopter near the maximum available flight performance
In this situation , the presence of adverse meteorological phenomena , such as freezing precipitation , or any type of mechanical malfunction leading to performance degradation , such as anomalies with the airflow or fuel control systems	a loss of rotor rpm
such as freezing precipitation , or any type of mechanical malfunction	performance degradation , such as anomalies with the airflow or fuel control systems , could have resulted in a loss of rotor rpm
incrementally deleterious effects on helicopter performance	little margin
Testing and examination of the engine and its ancillary systems found no defects	the loss of main rotor rpm
