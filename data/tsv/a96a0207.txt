the pilot wanting to remain clear of the windrow on the right side of the runway , or his removal of the 10 crosswind correction in preparation for landing	Considering that there was no mechanical or aerodynamic explanation for a directional control problem , it is most likely that a flight control input , or lack of input , allowed the aircraft to drift to the left
the aircraft approached the runway threshold	its landing lights would have illuminated the drifting snow and the snow covering much of the runway surface , probably making it difficult to distinguish the runway 's white centre line
direction , the pilot had a limited horizon comprised of the snow surface illuminated by the aircraft 's landing lights , which would have made recognition of the aircraft 's attitude extremely difficult	lights in
it was concluded that the engines were operating normally	high power at the time of impact
The only apparent conditions	the final stages of the flight
they	a safe landing
When the aircraft approached the runway threshold , its landing lights would have illuminated the drifting snow and the snow covering much of the runway surface	it difficult to distinguish the runway 's white centre line
The illuminated snow drifting across the runway at a 45 angle from behind the aircraft	a pilot the illusion of lateral aircraft motion
Considering that there was no mechanical or aerodynamic explanation for a directional control problem , it is most likely that a flight control input , or lack of input	the aircraft to drift to the left
the snow off the left side of the runway would have surprised the pilot	his subsequent performance in the missed approach
Heading left off the runway , in the dark and with a lack of ground lights in that direction , the pilot had a limited horizon comprised of the snow surface illuminated by the aircraft 's landing lights	recognition of the aircraft 's attitude extremely difficult
