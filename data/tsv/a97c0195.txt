flying training and were not a factor in the accident	The weather conditions at the time of the occurrence were ideal
a secondary stall was induced during the attempted spin recovery	impact likely indicate
It is possible for confusion or conflict to occur with regard to which pilot has control of the aircraft and is taking corrective action , particularly in a scenario involving an instructor pilot and a student instructor	, a manoeuvre could inadvertently be continued unsafely
the experience level of the instructor and the reported harmonious relationship between the pilots	it is unlikely that a poor instructor/student relationship developed during the flight that could have affected their judgement or ability to control the aircraft
both crew members were nonsmokers	they were found to have carbon monoxide levels of about three to nine per cent for the pilot-in-command and zero to five per cent for the student pilot
the location of the exhaust leak	to the left rear of the engine , it is possible that the concentration of carbon monoxide was greater near the pilot-in-command , and that his blood saturation level was consequently higher than that of the student pilot
the effects of decreased oxygen availability at 4 000 feet asl , the range becomes seven to thirteen per cent for the pilot-in-command and four to nine per cent for the student pilot	The carbon monoxide saturation levels found in both pilots , as detected by the toxicology testing , are not normally considered of significance in relation to an individual 's performance ; however , when a factor of four per cent is added
any such incapacitation occurred	particularly during a critical manoeuvre such as a spin , control of the aircraft have been affected
the carbon monoxide detector returns to its unexposed colour when the air freshens	checking the detector only during pre-start cockpit checks does not alert the crew of any previous carbon monoxide leaks into the cockpit
the effects of carbon monoxide in the cabin , whether such incapacitation took place could not be determined	Although the pilot-in-command 's mild atherosclerosis condition could have made him somewhat more susceptible to angina
either pilot	the spin continue to a low altitude above the ground
some other factor intervened	recovery action
Given the experience level of the instructor and the reported harmonious relationship between the pilots , it is unlikely that a poor instructor/student relationship developed during the flight	their judgement or ability
No pre-impact mechanical failure was found in the aircraft control system	a loss of control or control difficulties
the engine	the amount of power
the engine was functioning	recovery either
specifications	combustion gases escape into the crankcase
Exhaust gases leaking from a small hole in the number 4 cylinder exhaust stack	a build-up of carbon monoxide in the engine compartment
Toxicology tests for the presence of carbon monoxide	a level of zero to five per cent for the student pilot and three to nine per cent for the pilot-in-command
the pilot-in-command 's mild atherosclerosis condition	him somewhat more susceptible to angina because of the effects of carbon
