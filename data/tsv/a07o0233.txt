No air brake deployment was observed	, the aircraft speed and altitude was high for this stage of the approach
The pilot may have been hesitant to apply air brakes to correct the situation because of the previous pitch control issues	, the glider was now in a long-landing situation
overcorrecting	by excessive stick inputs to try and arrest the rapid descent
the steep descent	Although the pilot stabilized the oscillations , the glider remained high and
the previous pitch control issues	The pilot may have been hesitant to apply air brakes to correct the situation
As the landing distance available decreased , the pilot needed to deploy the air brakes	land on the remaining runway
these	two actions
this was the first flight on type	The pilot may not have been familiar with the flight characteristics of the glider
these	two actions
the instructor was	radio contact with the pilot at the expected return time
The examination of the glider	no pre-impact mechanical failures
The resultant long-landing situation	the pilot to utilize air brakes and forward stick input to land the glider on the remaining runway
