access to communication and in the rush to fit N6857P back into the traffic flow	the OJI did not have access to all the required data to ensure a safe and efficient approach sequence
The OJI was unaware of the airport circuit traffic	his actions were having on tower operations
no standards specify how close OJIs must be to the trainee	it was acceptable practice for OJIs to establish their own criteria
assuming control of a position between an OJI and a trainee	There is no formal policy on the best method
maintaining safe and efficient control of their traffic , whether working alone or monitoring a trainee , there are occasions where a loss of separation is imminent or has already occurred	Although OJIs have full responsibility
descend , or turn	climb
Similar training would benefit controllers who find themselves in an unfortunate event , such as a loss of separation ,	enable them to re-establish the required separation more effectively and quickly
passing	information concerning N6857P from his position to Victoria tower
a non-standard method for relaying information is used	controllers must use extra caution to ensure that the information is accorded the required priority and to confirm that the information has been properly understood
This was not done	, important information was missed during its onward transmission
At the time of the occurrence , the supervisor was replacing the tower radar controller	, he was unable to provide proper supervision
the time of the occurrence	the supervisor was replacing the tower radar controller
the tower staffing was reduced below the minimum required to fill all four control positions	complete a preliminary investigation after this occurrence and ensure the involved controllers were removed from duty
N6857P would be continuing with a visual approach to runway 27	controller did not correctly relay to the Victoria airport controller the information
the Victoria terminal specialty	the workload and complexity were moderate
Victoria tower	the workload was moderate to heavy
the OJI	the decision to continue vectoring N6857P toward the airport for an approach
the OJI was	a clearance to N6857P
communications	point
access to all the required data	a safe and efficient approach sequence
a rapid response is required	a situation does not worsen
with training	them respond appropriately to this type of situation , whether as a trainee or an OJI
the most efficient techniques to re-establish separation once it is lost -LRB- potentially or actually -RRB-	controllers
Similar training would benefit controllers who find themselves in an unfortunate event , such as a loss of separation , in order	them re-establish the required separation more effectively and quickly
Direct access by the data controller to the Victoria airport controller	more complete and timely coordination
he was	proper supervision
a preliminary investigation after this occurrence	the involved controllers were removed from duty
The OJI was	the landline communications panel from his position at the adjacent console
This	him communicate with other control agencies , such as the Victoria airport controller
