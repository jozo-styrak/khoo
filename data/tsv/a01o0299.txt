There was no clear reason why the north ground controller gave Tractor 197 authorization to proceed on a route that crossed the active runway without co-ordination with the north tower controller	the north ground controller gave Tractor 197 authorization to proceed on a route that crossed the active runway without co-ordination with the north tower controller
At the time of the occurrence , he was handling a heavy load of ground traffic , though not complex , mostly taxiing for take-off on Runway 15L	the north ground controller gave Tractor 197 authorization to proceed on a route that crossed the active runway without co-ordination with the north tower controller
His tasks , although quantitatively heavy , were routine and repetitive	His performance was skill-based , essentially responding automatically to routine demands in a highly familiar , but task-saturated , situation
controller co-ordinates crossings of active runways with the tower controller ; this means that no one outside the control tower , specifically the operators of vehicles or taxiing aircraft , has sufficient situational awareness to offer an effective defence in the event of error in the control tower	It is normal practice for ground traffic to remain on the ground control frequency rather than changing to the tower frequency for clearance across active runways
The north ground controller also has to handle ground traffic crossing Runway 15L , with the added workload of coordinating with tower and closely monitoring the runway.crossing	, the north ground controller experiences an inordinately high workload when Runway 15L is active
Airside vehicle operators are not required to stop and hold short of runways , as are pilots , if they do not have an explicit clearance from ATC to cross that specific runway	, vehicle operators do not serve , as do pilots , as an independent defence against air traffic control error
controller position -LRB- centre ground -RRB- is available for certain high-workload situations , but is not typically used when Runway 15L is in use	The north ground controller has an inordinately high workload whenever Runway 15L is in operation
The awareness program including the Aviation Safety Newsletter has not publicized new procedures and regulations recently adopted as preventive measures against runway incursions	, the recent changes concerning clearances across runways may have gone unnoticed

The media that are relevant to vehicle operators , such as the Aerodrome Safety Circular , posters and a video , are distributed to airport operators and depend on voluntary initiatives and local programmes	reach vehicle operators
Awareness of potential conflicts by vehicle drivers is limited by them being on a different radio frequency than the aircraft being cleared for take-off ,	drivers are unaware of the precise status of arriving and departing aircraft
their lower overall capacity , compared to simultaneous parallel operations from Runways 05/23 and 06L/24R	When Runways 15L/33R and 15R/33L are in use , the overall ATC workload in the tower appears to be reduced
Runways 15L/33R and 15R/33L are in use	the overall ATC workload in the tower appears to be reduced because of their lower overall capacity , compared to simultaneous parallel operations from Runways 05/23 and 06L/24R
the backlog that builds up on the ground	While the capacity limitation reduces the quantity of traffic being handled by tower controllers , it has the opposite effect on ground controllers
Runways 15L/R are in use	the backlogged ground traffic from all three terminals is concentrated on the north ground controller
