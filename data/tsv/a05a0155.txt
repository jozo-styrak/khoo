The examination of the helicopter did not reveal any technical anomalies	, this analysis will focus on environmental factors , the pilot 's decision to conduct the final trip to Go By Point and return , and the survival and organizational factors
Most CCG helicopter operations occur near shore	, even though the helicopters may be operating over water , immersion suits are not required by either the CARs or the OM because they are typically well within the distance-from-shore requirements
It is common practice during CCG flights for immersion suits to be worn only when mandatory	, pilots and passengers are often exposed to prolonged periods of operations over sometimes frigid water without appropriate protection
The emergency locator transmitters on board sank to the bottom and were not able to signal search and rescue of the accident	, search and rescue efforts did not begin until one hour after the flight 's planned estimated time of arrival
the helicopter departed Go By Point to return to Marystown	only light snow was falling
a turn to the right would have required flight into rapidly rising terrain with a possibility of encountering whiteout conditions	Once established on a westerly heading towards Marystown , it would have been difficult to turn around when severely reduced visibility was encountered
there was no emergency signal to notify SAR of the accident	rescue efforts were not initiated until one hour after the flight planned estimated time of arrival
a liferaft	the pilot and passenger were not equipped to survive prolonged cold water immersion
electronic SAR signalling been available	a search could have begun immediately
he had worn a lifejacket	he not have drowned
he had used a lifejacket	hypothermia have been an immediate threat to his survival
they are typically well within the distance-from-shore requirements	Therefore , even though the helicopters may be operating over water , immersion suits are not required by either the CARs or the OM
it was pinned against the centre rear passenger seat	The liferaft was unavailable after the impact
a passenger had been in the centre rear passenger seat	it is possible that the passenger have been pinned between the liferaft and the seat
the liferaft mounting bracket was not able to withstand a survivable rearward impact	There was an increased risk to those on board
the time of this accident	the liferaft mount head strike hazard identified in May 2005 had not been addressed
the time of the occurrence	Transport Canada Aircraft Services Directorate management had not taken steps to mitigate the liferaft mount head strike hazard
the time of the accident	the operator had not adequately addressed several identified operational shortcomings
There were VFR conditions throughout most of the period , but with scattered towering cumulus clouds -LRB- TCUs -RRB-	areas of sm visibility in snow showers
the weather conditions	a direct flight Marystown
the helicopter out over the water	the pilot to lose visual contact with the coast
This	him from selecting the particle separator , engine anti-ice , and continuous ignition switches that are required for flight in snow , and from arming the pop-out floats as he reduced airspeed below 60 knots in reduced visibility over the water
lack of fixed visual references over the water , and turbulence	pilot disorientation
off	the subsequent loss of control
immersion suits and aviation lifejackets	the chance of survival
an increased risk to those on board because the liferaft mounting bracket	a survivable rearward impact
The emergency locator transmitters on board sank to the bottom	search and rescue of the accident
