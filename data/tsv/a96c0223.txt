a constant supply of fuel and air	the fire progressed rapidly , causing heavy , black smoke as it burned through the avionics rack and plastic mouldings
The wiring had recently been replaced	, it is unlikely that abraded wiring would have caused an electrical short circuit
the	fire burning off the protective shielding to expose bare wires
the avionics relay could not be located at the crash site	however , its status can not be confirmed
the pilot reported that he had smoke coming into the cockpit	the aircraft was approximately 40 nm from Thunder Bay and between cloud levels at 7,000 feet asl
the weather conditions	the pilot knew that he would need the electrically driven navigation and communication equipment to complete the approach into Thunder Bay
the pilot radioed that the smoke was becoming very thick and that he was going to have to do something	the fire was probably out of control
the smoke and fire	The aircraft 's high rate of descent shortly after the last radio transmission and the aircraft 's steep impact angle indicate that the pilot likely became incapacitated
The progression of the fire damage suggests that a heat source likely ignited a bag of bankers ' dispatch notes	a localized fire in the nose baggage compartment
Given a constant supply of fuel and air , the fire progressed rapidly	heavy , black smoke
abraded wiring	an electrical short circuit
As the aircraft descended from 7,000 feet asl , it would have entered the cloud	the pilot 's reliance on electrical power for directional guidance
