This event took place during the hours of darkness , under a cloud-covered sky	, it is reasonable to conclude that the vision of the involved crew and of the tower controller was adversely affected
the crew of ABL523 indicated to the tower that the flight was ready for take-off at taxiway D3	they anticipated that the controller would either clear them for an immediate take-off or direct them to hold
higher priority tasks	Although the controller heard ABL523 's request for take-off , the controller did not respond -
the clearance had been transmitted immediately following their request for take-off , the crew believed that the clearance had been directed to their aircraft in response to their request	Because the crew of ABL523 had missed the call sign in the controller 's transmission to QXE31 , and
the controller did not correct ABL523 's readback of the take-off clearance	the crew took it to mean that the readback had been correct and that they were cleared to take off and follow a Richmond 6 departure to 3000 feet
using	available ASDE
multiple intersections for departure	because several aircraft could be positioned adjacent to the runway and ready for take-off
other potential workload distractions	it more difficult for the controller to notice that a second aircraft had moved onto the runway
Darkness	aircraft lighting
ATC procedures	this increased risk during night operations
operations adversely affected the controller 's ability to see ABL523 taxi onto the runway	the ABL523 crew seeing the preceding aircraft before the take-off roll was initiated
operations	the controller 's ability to see ABL523 taxi onto the runway
the use of multiple intersections for departures	risk of a runway incursion error occurring
Requiring pilots to refrain from calling the tower to obtain a take-off clearance , while resulting in a less-congested frequency	uncertainty
uncertainty	pilots '
