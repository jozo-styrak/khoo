for the incorrect frequency selection is not known , but it is possible that a frequency selection or scan button may have inadvertently activated after the pilot put the radio in his shirt pocket	Although this examination can not confirm what frequency was selected at the time the aircraft entered the ATF area , it is known that neither the pilot of C-GWAC nor the passenger of C-FBVW heard any radio transmissions from the other aircraft
Additionally , while in the downwind leg , and during the final turn , his ability to see the conflicting traffic would have been impaired by visual interference from the cockpit dash , the aircraft 's engine section , and the passenger	was that the visual search procedure used by the occupants of C-FBVW was ineffective
doing so , the pilot gave up any ability he had to monitor the ATF directly , by doing so	he reduced the effectiveness of the established radio protocols as a defence to support the see and avoid principle
the opposing traffic was operating in a left-hand pattern and approached from above and to the pilot 's left side	This visual search procedure was ineffective
neither pilot detected the potential collision	neither took avoidance action prior to the collision
neither pilot saw the other aircraft prior to the in-flight collision	The see and avoid principle was ineffective as a method of separating aircraft
doing so	the pilot gave up any ability he had to monitor the ATF directly
the pilot of C-FBVW	the only available radio headset his passenger
he	the effectiveness of the established radio protocols as a defence to support the see and avoid principle
the pilot of C-GWAC	then any transmission
other aircraft in the area	any transmissions
this pilot	the risk of an in-flight collision
The pilot of C-GWAC	a radio call
The non-use of available lighting systems	the visual conspicuousness of an aircraft and
The non-use of available lighting systems reduces the visual conspicuousness of an aircraft	the risk of it
The pilot of C-GWAC conducted a straight-in approach to runway 32 rather than using the recommended circuit joining procedure	the opportunity to be seen by other traffic
However	a post-crash examination of that radio
The pilot of C-FBVW	the only available radio headset his passenger
all available aircraft lighting systems	the visual conspicuousness of his aircraft
