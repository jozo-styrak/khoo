As the pilot tried to arrest the helicopter 's descent , rotor rpm decayed , and not enough thrust was available to cushion the landing	the smoke or when power was lost , a successful landing with reduced power
Periodic power checks or inspections for sulfidation corrosion , which most likely would also have detected a power loss and the corroded turbine components , were not undertaken , nor were they required	A blade in the number 1 GP turbine failed of fatigue , which resulted from sulfidation corrosion ; the engine lost power as a result of the blade failure
the hard	landing and rollover
the engine did not appear to suffer any damage from the hard landing , it was concluded that the imbalance occurred at about the time the smoke came into the cabin	Also ,
lowering	the collective
the landing gear skid tubes and forward cross tube broke	the cross tubes rotated aft and up
the helicopter was on its side	the other door was not usable
fatigue , which resulted from sulfidation corrosion	A blade in the number 1 GP turbine failed
the blade failure	A blade in the number 1 GP turbine failed as a result of fatigue , which resulted from sulfidation corrosion ; the engine lost power
damage from the hard landing showed that the main rotor transmission rocked fore and aft , deformed its mounts	the transmission tilt forward enough to pull the coupling apart
either power checks or maintenance inspections	the discovery of the corroded turbine components
The identified sulfidation	the GP turbine blades
The loss of the blade and other blade sections caused an imbalance	damage to the turbine seals
The loss of the blade and other blade sections	an imbalance , which then likely resulted in damage to the turbine seals
It is likely that the seal damage allowed the release of oil onto hot engine areas	the soot in the turbine at the joint between the turbine nozzle and the number 1 GP turbine and the smoke in the cabin
the seal damage	the release of oil onto hot engine areas
The after-market step that was attached to the cross tubes came up against the pilot door and the rotated cross tubes caused the step to be jammed against the door	it opening normally
the rotated cross tubes	the step to be jammed against the door
