fatigue ; the origin of the failure	the spindle did not receive the required magnetic particle inspection at the last overhaul
failure could not be determined	the spindle
the earlier damage	Although the time interval from crack initiation to final failure could not be calculated , it is likely that the crack existed at the time of the transmission overhaul
the	crack have been detected had the spindle received the MPI that was required
several factors relating to the control of the transmission overhaul	The MPI process was omitted
this was not the standard procedure	That the upper case was purchased separately , and was sent out for NDT inspection with the spindles attached , created the confusion ,
fatigue	The spindle failed
a	lack of maintenance supervision during the overhaul process
thereby creating bending loads on the tail rotor drive shaft which rapidly caused it to fail	move
The failure of the transmission spindle mount	the transmission to pivot and become misaligned
This movement	a bending load
This movement placed a bending load on the tail rotor drive shaft	failure
the instant failure of the spindle	the noise
Omission of the MPI , however	the chances of early detection
That the upper case was purchased separately , and was sent out for NDT inspection with the spindles attached	the confusion
The use of an additional check sheet , identifying the components that require NDT	the omission of the MPI
The failure of the spindle	the transmission move , thereby creating bending loads on the tail rotor drive shaft which rapidly caused it to fail
The failure of the spindle allowed the transmission to move , thereby creating bending loads on the tail rotor drive shaft	it to fail
the transmission to move	bending loads on the tail rotor drive shaft which rapidly caused it to fail
