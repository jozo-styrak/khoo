The input freewheel unit -LRB- IFWU -RRB- and drive shaft assembly failed	, the engine could not drive the transmission and the main-rotor blades
The operator did not perform the 800-hour inspection of the IFWU assembly required by the Eurocopter maintenance manual	, the contamination and excessive wear of the freewheel internal parts were not detected
this high power setting and blade pitch angle	the loss of drive resulted in rapid decay of the main-rotor rpm
15 minutes of flight before requiring refuelling	It was assessed that the fuel remaining at impact was sufficient
the engine was capable of producing full power during the test cell examination , vibration levels were acceptable the engine was operating on the ground after impact	it is concluded that the engine did not lose power during flight
determining TBO	Eurocopter considers time-in-service the sole parameter
The IFWU was subjected to a high number of loading cycles and contamination	, the IFWU , with only 1090 hours since overhaul , malfunctioned before its TBO
A review of the technical records for the accident helicopter revealed that the 800-hour inspection of the IFWU was not accomplished	knowledge of its structural integrity was compromised
Compliance with this inspection may reduce the risk of failure by affording an opportunity to identify anomalies	return the IFWU to a Eurocopter - approved repair facility for overhaul and to clean the unit of contamination before return to service
its design , contaminating the IFWU	This metal debris was trapped within the assembly
and the IFWU may disengage -LRB- or freewheel -RRB- and then re-engage	accelerate
the wear on the internal parts caused by the repeated heavy lift operations and because of the contamination suspended and trapped in the lubricating oil between the unit 's rotating parts	The IFWU failed
the approved rotorcraft flight manual supplement for the composite main-rotor blades supplemental type certificate was not incorporated in the accident helicopter 's flight manual and the pitch indicator gauge was not placarded in accordance with the approved supplement	The operator may not have respected the limitation associated with the LOM blade installation
the IFWU	a service life limit
Out-of-ground-effect manoeuvring at this density altitude at high gross weight	a large torque loading
the loss of drive	rapid decay of the main-rotor rpm
The pilot could not regain the rpm	the helicopter from descending rapidly when the lift being generated by the rotor blades was no longer sufficient to sustain flight
the lift being generated by the rotor blades was	flight
Jettisoning the load lightened the helicopter	it climb momentarily
The scheduled TBO for the Lama 's IFWU	the number of operating cycles
Compliance with this inspection	the risk of failure by affording an opportunity to identify anomalies and consequently return the IFWU to a Eurocopter - approved repair facility for overhaul and to clean the unit of contamination before return to service
During the freewheeling condition and repeated cyclic loading of the IFWU , the debris generated by the wear processes acted as an abrasive	wear of the cage/retainer , ramps , ring , and rollers
Rapid descent and flare	the main rotor
This situation	overloading the IFWU
The combination of the loss of drive and the operating flight regime	the main-rotor rpm decaying so rapidly that the pilot was unable to control the loss of rotor rpm
the pilot was	the loss of rotor rpm
the repeated heavy lift operations	the wear on the internal parts
The manner in which the helicopter was operated allowed freewheeling to occur during rapid descents	accelerated wear of the subcomponent parts through disengagements and successive re-engagements
The manner in which the helicopter was operated	freewheeling to occur during rapid descents , contributing to accelerated wear of the subcomponent parts through disengagements and successive re-engagements
This situation	overloading the IFWU
Eurocopter	the reuse and mixing of subcomponent parts during repair or at overhaul
Time-continued or on-condition components have subcomponent parts that may satisfy overhaul criteria but that have accrued time in service and cycles in operation	their future life expectancy or maintenance schedule
The helicopter was operated repeatedly in a hover about 165 feet above ground level	the helicopter in the Avoid Continuous Operation section of the speed altitude envelope chart
