For undetermined reasons , the aircraft contacted the water in a nose-low attitude on landing or entered a nose-low attitude shortly after touchdown	, the left float dug in and the aircraft cartwheeled
the landing area in the bay was relatively short and was bordered with trees and a rising shoreline	precision flying was required to prevent running into the far shore
the door handles had been rotated sufficiently to unlatch the doors	As well , the aircraft had sustained impact damage that have prevented the normal opening of the cabin doors , even
they were unable to open the main exits after the cabin submerged	Their survival opportunities were further decreased
precision flying was required	running into the far shore
The decision to land in the bay	the risk associated with the landing
This would have generated high water drag on the float	the pitch-down tendency
The pilot was	positive control of the aircraft
Despite having received no immobilizing injuries , the survivors were unable to locate the cabin door handles in the inverted aircraft	their escape from the submerged cabin
the survivors were	the cabin door handles in the inverted aircraft , delaying their escape from the submerged cabin
As well , the aircraft had sustained impact damage	the normal opening of the cabin doors
they were	and
Defences in place to assist occupants in escaping from submerged seaplanes include restraint systems	impact injuries and pre-flight safety briefings and
Defences in place to assist occupants in escaping from submerged seaplanes include restraint systems to reduce impact injuries and pre-flight safety briefings and safety-feature cards	to prepare them for the possibility of an underwater emergency exit
requirements	seaplane egress more achievable in emergency conditions
they were	the main exits after the cabin submerged
The survivors were unable to locate the interior door handles after the seaplane became inverted and submerged in the water	them using the doors as emergency exits
The survivors were	the interior door handles after the seaplane became inverted and submerged in the water , thus preventing them from using the doors as emergency exits
The life preservers were not stowed in an area	them easily accessible to the occupants
The baggage was not secured in the baggage compartment	the risk of injury the occupants during the crash
The weight of the baggage in cargo area 1 probably exceeded the compartment 's structural limit	the probability of damage the aircraft
