two purposes	The pilot was flying to Gimli
the deteriorating weather conditions	The aircraft crashed on a westward heading , indicating the pilot had probably decided to reverse course
the darkness and weather conditions	the pilot would have needed to revert to instrument flight to make the course reversal turn
an overnight stop	him seeing his friend in Gimli , who was leaving the next day
the combination of nighttime darkness , limited surface lighting , low overcast clouds and reduced visibility in drizzle	it very difficult for the pilot to maintain visual reference with the surface
low overcast clouds	visibility in drizzle
to instrument flight	the course reversal turn
the descent in time	impact with the surface
pilot	the designated responsible person
The pilot 's instrument flying skills were most likely not adequate to safely complete the course reversal turn	an inadvertent descent that was not detected and corrected in time to prevent impact with the surface
in time	impact with the surface
