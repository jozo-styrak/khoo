First , contamination was caused from freezing precipitation or snow after de-icing could have occurred ; and/or second , not all ice or snow was removed during the de-icing process -LRB- it can be difficult for the de-ice operator to see between the elevator and the spring tabs because the trailing edge of the elevator tends to be pointed downward when the aircraft is stationary -RRB-	there to be sufficient contamination to obstruct the spring tab movement
ice	the elevator control system and how and when the ice may have adhered to the control system in such a way as to affect the operation of the system
moving the control column aft , this action should have moved the elevator surface upward as air loads increased	caused the spring tab to move downward to assist in relieving control forces
the First Officer rotated the aircraft for take-off by moving the control column aft	this action should have moved the elevator surface upward , and as air loads increased , caused the spring tab to move downward to assist in relieving control forces
the spring tab was not moveable ,	as the airspeed increased the pilot would feel a corresponding increase in backward pressure on the control column
control of the aircraft was transferred to the Captain	his response to the back pressure and full forward trim condition was to apply a high breakout force on the trim wheel
the trim released	the control column moved abruptly
ice and/or frozen snow contamination	In the absence of any evidence of mechanical failure or obstruction , and that the aircraft was operating in known icing conditions , the obstruction was most probably
Icing of the elevator surface , elevator horns	of the weight of ice were also examined
None of these latter scenarios would present conditions similar to those experienced by the crew	, it was concluded that the most probable scenario was that spring tab movement was restricted by an ice obstruction
the trailing edge of the elevator tends to be pointed downward when the aircraft is stationary -RRB-	First , contamination was caused from freezing precipitation or snow after de-icing could have occurred ; and/or second , not all ice or snow was removed during the de-icing process -LRB- it can be difficult for the de-ice operator to see between the elevator and the spring tabs
an obstruction caused by an accumulation of ice and/or frozen snow in the gap between the spring tab and the elevator	The elevator spring tab movement was restricted after take-off , probably
full nose-down trim was applied to counteract the back-pressure on the control column	it jammed in that position
to the control system in such a way as	the operation of the system
When the First Officer rotated the aircraft for take-off by moving the control column aft , this action should have moved the elevator surface upward , and as air loads increased	the spring tab to move downward to assist in relieving control forces
then as the airspeed	the pilot would feel a corresponding increase in backward pressure on the control column
Possible scenarios	this flight control obstruction
in itself	and
it	the residual ice or snow may not have been removed during de-icing
an accumulation of ice	an obstruction
