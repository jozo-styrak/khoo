Even though the PF had to concentrate on controlling the aircraft , the PF rather than the PNF should have been more likely to detect the left drift	, other factors may have degraded the PF 's visual environment
Another factor influencing the PF 's visual environment was the combination of contact lenses and new eyeglasses	of the reflection from the freezing fog could have been greater for the PF than for the PNF
the captain banked the aircraft four to five degrees to the left , removing the crosswind correction	Analysis of the FDR information and flight simulation indicated that the aircraft began to drift left
this point	only the two rows of runway edge lights were visible and appeared at an angle to the aircraft heading
monitoring the approach predominately inside the cockpit , looked up and saw that the aircraft was drifting	Once visual references were acquired by the PF and the autopilot was disconnected in preparation for landing , the first officer , as PNF responsible
the	reflection from the freezing fog could have been greater for the PF than for the PNF
the characteristic of progressive eyeglass	Second , the PF may have had some distortion and loss of night vision capability that had not been experienced previously
landings	crosswind
the	vision correction used by the PF adversely affected his ability to consistently use the required visual references effectively in the rapidly changing , high workload environment of a night landing in low visibility with a crosswind
the	vision correction used by the pilot flying interfered with his ability to effectively use the visual references available to land
the absence of a CVR recording	a review of the crew 's interaction
The captain 's decision was consistent with company operating procedures , and a normal landing in the vicinity of the runway centreline should have been assured	the captain 's training
the reflection from freezing fog particles	the runway threshold
Another factor	the PF 's visual environment
the drift	the appropriate control inputs
one or more of the effects of the vision correction used by the PF adversely	his ability to consistently use the required visual references effectively in the rapidly changing , high workload environment of a night landing in low visibility with a crosswind
The captain aligned the aircraft with the runway without compensating for crosswind	the aircraft to drift off centreline
