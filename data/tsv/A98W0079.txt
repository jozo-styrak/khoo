When N48BA contacted the Departure Controller , CMM368 was climbing and passing through 8,500 feet	, the appropriate altitude clearance limit for N48BA would have been 8,000 feet
a two-runway system is in use at Calgary International Airport	normal departure procedures result in north and eastbound traffic departing from one runway while west and southbound traffic depart from the other runway
CMM368 to take off from runway 34 and N48BA to take off from runway 28	Normal procedure for the two aircraft involved would have been
the location on the airport of executive aircraft	However ,
the direction of flight after departure	Furthermore , had both aircraft departed runway 34 , separation would have been assured
both aircraft departed runway 34	separation would have been assured because of the direction of flight after departure
N48BA contacted the Departure Controller	CMM368 was climbing and passing through 8,500 feet
extra safeguards are not put in place at the time of the deviation or additional time available to monitor the situation until positive separation is achieved is not available ,	there is a higher risk of something going wrong
decision to allow the two aircraft to depart from non-standard runways	the
traffic warrants	The Departure Controller deny a non-standard departure
this point	the Departure Controller determined that adequate spacing existed to allow each aircraft an unrestricted climb
the Departure Controller did not sufficiently monitor the progress of this flight	The change in rate of climb of the A320 aircraft was not detected
inadequate scanning techniques and the absence of additional progress reports requested by the controller	There have been a number of recent TSB reports -LRB- A97C0144 , A97H0007 , A98H0002 -RRB- where controllers have not detected impending conflicts
He did not anticipate that the pilot of the A320 would change his flight profile	reduce the aircraft climb rate to about 800 fpm while increasing the speed by about 100 knots
assuring positive separation of aircraft , as specified in NAV CANADA ATC MANOPS , were not followed	Procedures
normal departure procedures	north and eastbound traffic departing from one runway
This procedure eliminates the need to have flight paths cross after departure	positive lateral separation
The controller 's willingness to shorten the taxi distances for both aircraft	a change to the normal flow of departure traffic
The pressure to move traffic quickly , without undue delay , was the overriding factor in the decision	the two aircraft depart from non-standard runways
In this case , the controller chose	the departures proceed
adequate spacing existed	each aircraft
sufficient radar monitoring of the flights	a timely hand-off the next sector
the possibility of the aircraft performance changing	the spacing established with the other aircraft
other control responsibilities	distraction
an inadequate periodic scan of the radar display	the failure of the controller
his flight profile	the aircraft climb rate about 800 fpm while increasing the speed by about 100 knots
On reaching 10,000 feet , the pilot selected a higher speed	the aircraft rate of climb being reduced until that speed is attained
a situation change from what was expected	the controller to confirm that the originally envisaged plan is unfolding as desired
The RDPS	two
Neither of these two tools	the loss of separation
it	a reminder to the controller the unusual flight path of the two aircraft , different from the normally used procedures , required an extra level of monitoring
This type of system	some type of warning to the controller that a loss of separation is imminent and that action is required to resolve it
Technical problems , which persist to this day	the conflict alert system being implemented
This type of tool	an additional safeguard
