Given the flight time and the distance to the impact point , the permutations of the radius of turn for various airspeeds show that the Electra would have described an arc over the ground dictated by two variables - airspeed and bank angle - with the wind as a constant	, the most likely airspeed-bank combinations range from 135 to 150 knots and 40 to 45 degrees , neither of which is unreasonable for this type of operation
The exit route down the valley toward Moyie Lake was always available to the pilots in the event of a mechanical malfunction that required manoeuvring room over flat terrain	, since the aircraft did not deviate from its arcing path to the left , it is unlikely that the pilots were dealing with a situation preventing climb performance or with a flight control malfunction
The reasonable conclusion is , therefore , that the engines were capable of delivering rated power before the impact	of the rate of climb assessments reveal that the Electra could have attained climb rates in the order of 1000 fpm at any stage during the left turn
In concert with the airspeed and angle of bank calculations , the results of the rate of climb assessments reveal that the Electra could have attained climb rates in the order of 1000 fpm at any stage during the left turn	, with consideration of the known flight path and altitude profile , no mechanical reason , aerodynamic effect , or performance factor was found that would have prevented the aircraft from attaining sufficient altitude to avoid the terrain
to why the aircraft did not climb to avoid the terrain becomes one of human performance	Accordingly , with consideration of the known flight path and altitude profile , no mechanical reason , aerodynamic effect , or performance factor was found that would have prevented the aircraft from attaining sufficient altitude to avoid the terrain
for the pilots not climbing their aircraft can not be identified with any certainty	It is also possible that , after initiating a satisfactory rate of climb for the seemingly benign task to climb to 4500 feet , the pilots became distracted in the cockpit and unintentionally allowed the climb to deteriorate

the aircraft climbed more than the observed 200 feet difference , only to lose it again	It not be determined
the lack of direct knowledge of the cockpit circumstances leading to the accident	, the reason for the pilots not climbing their aircraft can not be identified with any certainty
and it is most likely that the Electra pilots were deceived by the apparent gently sloping nature of the surrounding terrain and did not detect the ridgeline that crossed their flight path	assess
the flight path and the rate of climb chosen	a collision with the terrain was unavoidable
Although a functional cockpit voice recorder was installed in the aircraft , it was not required by regulation and it was not used	, vital clues that could have shed light on the circumstances of this accident were not available
severe impact forces that exceeded the design criteria	The emergency locator transmitter could not transmit a signal
The aircraft wreckage was examined to the extent possible	the massive destruction and loss by fire
Values outside these finite ranges were found	great divergence from the last minute of flight path and
a situation	climb performance
Accordingly , with consideration of the known flight path and altitude profile , no mechanical reason , aerodynamic effect , or performance factor was found	the aircraft attaining sufficient altitude to avoid the terrain
the cockpit and unintentionally	the climb to deteriorate
direct knowledge of the cockpit circumstances	the accident , the reason for the pilots not climbing their aircraft can not be identified with any certainty
Nonetheless , several factors exist	a possible explanation
Compounding their difficulty in detecting the obstacles ahead of them were the limitations to unimpeded vision resulting from the left bank in the turn toward the rising terrain	their perspective and field of vision
Vision limitations resulting from cockpit design and layout characteristics	a pilot 's opportunity
The characteristics of the terrain were deceptive	it difficult for the pilots to perceive their proximity and rate of closure to the rising ground in sufficient time to avoid it
Performance calculations show that the Electra - in the absence of limiting mechanical malfunction - could have climbed at a rate	the aircraft to avoid the terrain
