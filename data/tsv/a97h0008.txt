a combination of an over-pressure condition in the strut and a gland nut	was weakened by a manufacturing defect
the aircraft was serviced in Vancouver , nine days prior to the accident	the maintenance crew followed the procedures depicted on the instruction plate on the gear leg
was still well below the red line on the gauge	maintenance workers to an overcharged condition
servicing the gear 's shock strut were exemplified in such a way as to invite a reversal in the order of charging of its low-and high-pressure stages	The placarded instructions
recharging of the centerline gear in the aircraft maintenance manual -LRB- AMM -RRB- at TASK 12-14-32-614-806 dated Jul 01/97 need clarification	Instructions
a manufacturing defect	The strength of the gland nut was reduced
a manufacturing defect	the result of a combination of an over-pressure condition in the strut and a gland nut
order	an overcharged gear strut
