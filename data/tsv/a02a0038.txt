The significance of the discrepancy in the CRFIs was not recognized by ground personnel	, there was no re-assessment of the validity of the Runway 05 CRFI measurement
This value is below the recommended minimum CRFI value for the crosswind	, the aircraft began to drift and yaw uncontrollably after touchdown
Given this relatively short time , the crew would not expect there would be a significant change to the friction characteristics	relied on the RSC/CRFI report to establish the suitability of Runway 05 for landing and the requirement for snow removal
this relatively short time	the crew would not expect there would be a significant change to the friction characteristics and consequently relied on the RSC/CRFI report to establish the suitability of Runway 05 for landing and the requirement for snow removal
snow falls onto a surface that is just above the freezing point	it melts and turns into slush
the	provision of this information have altered their decision to land or require runway cleaning
slush	an aircraft 's stopping performance
the presence of slush been known	the crew would still have been unable to assess its effect on the runway surface characteristics
slush contamination	The poor friction characteristics of the runway ,
The significance of the discrepancy in the Canadian Runway Friction Index -LRB- CRFI -RRB- values between the two runways was not recognized by ground personnel	, there was no re-assessment of the validity of the Runway 05 CRFI measurement
slush	a runway 's friction characteristics
melting was taking	the airfield
the crew	its effect on the runway surface characteristics
Given the differences in RSC reports on the two runways	emphasis on the removal of contaminants as rapidly and completely as possible
The crew 's decisions to forgo runway clearing and proceed to land was	RSC/CRFI information became invalid shortly after it was measured
