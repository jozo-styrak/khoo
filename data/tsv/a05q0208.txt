the amount and quality of sleep he had during the 72 hours preceding the accident ; how his work schedule was structured ; and the pilot 's flight time , flight duty time and rest time while acting as instructor or assistant chief instructor for Grondair	, the pilot 's work schedule could not be established , and the effect of his work schedule on his rest time could not be assessed
For these reasons , the pilot 's work schedule could not be established , and the effect of his work schedule on his rest time could not be assessed	, it was not possible to correlate the pilot 's decisions and actions with the level of fatigue that he mentioned
Although the aircraft was certified and equipped for IFR flight , the company 's operating certificate did not authorize it to be operated in IMC	, the flight plan had to be based on night VFR
the area to be overflown was partly covered by fog ; messages received from the aircraft indicate that the weather conditions prevented the wildlife protection officers from determining their position relative to the terrain ; the meteorological conditions were conducive to the formation of fog ; and shortly after take-off , the team in the aircraft redeployed the ground teams to the Disra li area , which lies to the southwest of the area initially selected	, it is probable that the pilot departed in weather conditions that were acceptable from a regulatory standpoint but that later deteriorated
The Canadian Aviation Regulations do not require that a pilot 's work time as an instructor be recorded in a log	, although the pilot mentioned that he was tired before the flight , his level of fatigue could not be assessed due to a lack of information
a lack of information	Although the pilot mentioned that he was tired when he got back from N miscau , the extent of his fatigue could not be determined
he was performing the duties of assistant chief instructor , flight instructor and charter pilot	However , it is reasonable to believe that the pilot had a heavy workload
assessment of his level of fatigue	an
For these reasons , the pilot 's work schedule could not be established	of his work schedule on his rest time could not be assessed
The Quebec minist re des Ressources naturelles et de la Faune did not specify any meteorological or operational criteria for night aerial surveillance of poaching activities	, the wildlife protection officers had no meteorological references to aid them in deciding whether the mission was feasible
he regularly used the Saint-Georges aerodrome to practise IFR approaches with his students	the pilot should have known that the VOR inbound approach radial for Runway 06 was the 045 radial
following a heading of 067 M	the pilot could either intercept the 045 radial to the right or proceed directly to the town of Saint-Georges
the pilot filed a flight plan and the operations manager	who was providing flight following service , was available by telephone , the regulatory requirements with respect to flight following were fulfilled
the aircraft crashed outside the planned surveillance area	the search took longer
it was in a clearing nearly on the inbound radial for Runway 06 at Saint-Georges	If the pilot had been able to advise the Qu bec FIC of his intentions , the wreckage would have been located sooner
there is no regular weather observation station at the Saint-Fr d ric or Saint-Georges aerodromes	the local weather information is transmitted by witnesses , pilots and automated weather observation stations
way	the pilot proceeded
he had elected to go IFR	he have been required to declare an emergency and notify ATC to get IFR clearance
there were no IFR charts on board	the pilot would be compelled to request ATC assistance
The aircraft proceeded towards Saint-Georges without the knowledge of the operator or the wildlife protection officers on the ground	, the search took longer because the aircraft crashed outside the agreed surveillance area
a lack of information	Consequently , although the pilot mentioned that he was tired before the flight , his level of fatigue could not be assessed
the ELT was destroyed after impact	No emergency locator transmitter -LRB- ELT -RRB- signals were received
The Quebec minist re des Ressources naturelles et de la Faune had not specified any meteorological or operational criteria for night aerial surveillance of poaching activities	, the wildlife protection officers had no meteorological references to aid them in deciding whether the mission was feasible
Examination of the wreckage and components revealed no evidence of airframe failure , control malfunction or loss of power	the accident
Examination of the wreckage and components	no evidence of airframe failure , control malfunction or loss of power that could have caused the accident
pilot	the flight
the following factors	his decision
the flight plan had	night VFR
the information available before the flight	the pilot and wildlife protection officers conclude that , in all probability , the wildlife protection officers in the aircraft would have a hard time carrying out their tasks
the weather	him landing back at the Saint-Fr d ric aerodrome
telephone	the operations manager , who was providing flight following service , available
Since the pilot filed a flight plan and the operations manager	flight following service
With the aircraft flying below the altitude	it communicate with the Qu bec FIC , ATC services received no messages from the pilot
the pilot had been	the Qu bec FIC of his intentions
the weather	the wildlife protection officers in the aircraft identifying ground references and may have hampered the pilot 's ability to navigate
the weather prevented the wildlife protection officers in the aircraft from identifying ground references	the pilot 's ability to navigate
the weather conditions	the wildlife protection officers determining their position relative to the terrain
the meteorological conditions were	the formation of fog
the weather conditions	the pilot the external visual references
Given that the aircraft crashed 20 miles east of Disra li , it is plausible that the weather conditions deprived the pilot of the external visual references	him find the agreed rendezvous point
the many lights in the town of Saint-Georges	a visible glow
The dark terrain below the aircraft and the lights in the distance	the pilot to think that he was higher than he was
