In addition , since the part number on the repaired HPTN assembly was identified in SB -LRB- CFM56-5 -RRB- 72-207 , the Air Canada engineering and maintenance staff assumed -LRB- without consulting with CFMI -RRB- that a 1,600-cycle inspection which did not include a borescope inspection of the guide vane convex surfaces was adequate	, the repaired HPTN assembly nozzle guide vanes were not being inspected in accordance with the CFMI engineering recommendations for the service evaluation , and the fact that the convex surface of a nozzle guide vane had a substantial amount of material missing went unnoticed until the engine failure
Cracks of less than 0.10 inch have been shown by CFMI not to be a threat to blade integrity	, there is no reduction of the inspection interval time for blades cracked within that limit
was significant enough in combination with the slightly defective HPT blade to result in failure of the HTP blade and , ultimately , internal failure of the engine	fail
The liberated blade air foil interfered with adjacent and downstream moving engine parts	the overload separation of the remaining HPT blades and secondary low pressure turbine impact
the slightly defective HPT blade	failure of the HTP blade and , ultimately , internal failure of the engine
CFMI for an in-service evaluation of the repair procedures	assembly was a repaired unit
The inspection information that was received by the Air Canada engineering and maintenance department , after being passed through several CFMI departments then several Air Canada departments , was incorrect -- it detailed that a one-time , 800-hour inspection was required	no reference the borescope inspection criteria for the convex surfaces of the HPTN assembly nozzle guide vanes
for the HPTN assembly components	the in-service evaluation
The undetected progressive deterioration of an engine HPT nozzle segment guide vane	the propagation of a fatigue crack in one of the engine 's high pressure turbine blade air foils
the liberated blade	the internal failure of the aircraft engine
