Also , Air Canada Jazz CRJ705 cockpit reference material did not include information on Vmd limitations	, the crew of JZA8105 was not aware that , unlike in the CRJ200 , long-range cruise speed in the CRJ705 could be less than Vmd at altitudes near the aircraft service ceiling
Therefore , the crew of JZA8105 was not aware that , unlike in the CRJ200 , long-range cruise speed in the CRJ705 could be less than Vmd at altitudes near the aircraft service ceiling	, the decision to slow the aircraft to 0.70 M , which was below the Vmd of 0.75 M , while attempting to maintain a constant altitude , was not an appropriate course of action
The flight crew of JZA8105 were not aware that , under their flight conditions , a low margin of power was available to sustain level flight at cruise altitude at a speed below Vmd	, the crew initiated an airspeed reduction to below Vmd , from which the aircraft was unable to accelerate without loss of altitude
The captain was not well rested before the flight	of fatigue likely resulted in a degradation of his concentration and prolonged diversion of attention from monitoring of airspeed after power reduction
The effects of fatigue likely resulted in a degradation of his concentration and prolonged diversion of attention from monitoring of airspeed after power reduction	The airspeed was allowed to fall below the targeted value
occurrence	the
the captain was alerted to the airspeed falling below the targeted 0.70 M	the viable speed - recovery options in order of effectiveness were to begin a descent , and to increase power
he advanced the power levers	the engine power available at FL 400 was only slightly more than that required for cruise
the captain selected the FCC vertical speed mode	decrease

fatigue	likely resulted in a degradation of his concentration and prolonged diversion of attention from monitoring of airspeed after power reduction
the benefit of this training	the captain 's initial response for airspeed recovery was ineffective , which eventually resulted in stick shaker activation
