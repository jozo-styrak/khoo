drifting snow during low visibility taxi and ground manoeuvring lastly	the flight crew 's non-conformance with company SOPs
The first officer made it known to the captain that he was not familiar with uncontrolled aerodrome procedures	the captain assisted the first officer in his PNF duties , thereby increasing his own workload
he was not fully aware of the environment in which he was operating	frequency indicated
using ARCAL lighting exist in the Canada Flight Supplement -LRB- CFS -RRB- as well as the Air Canada Route Manual Supplement , which is Skyservice 's primary source of airport supplementary information	There is no Transport Canada regulation requiring them to do so ; however , instructions
the aircraft 's proximity to the end of the runway and the speed at which the aircraft was taxied , it failed to remain within the confines of the runway	The captain observed the runway end lights after the ARCAL lighting system was activated and applied heavy braking ; however ,
operating at uncontrolled aerodromes and in the use of ARCAL lighting and , as a result , the captain conducted both PF and PNF duties , which increased his workload	The first officer was unfamiliar with procedures
The captain made the appropriate radio calls while manoeuvring the aircraft on the taxiways and prior to proceeding onto the runway ; however , these transmissions were not made on the ATF of 124.7 MHz.The flight crew did not adhere to uncontrolled aerodrome procedures	were not aware of any communiques directed to them on the ATF
In this occurrence , a number of factors combined	the runway excursion
The first officer made it known to the captain that he was not familiar with uncontrolled aerodrome procedures and as a result the captain assisted the first officer in his PNF duties	his own workload
The first officer	it known to the captain that he was not familiar with uncontrolled aerodrome procedures and as a result the captain assisted the first officer in his PNF duties , thereby increasing his own workload
The captain	the subsequent appropriate radio calls while manoeuvring on the taxiways and prior to back-taxiing on the runway
The strong tailwind with blowing snow conditions	the crew the illusion of moving slower than they were actually moving
the aircraft ground speed	a safe taxi speed while back-taxiing on the runway
The flight crew continued to taxi at night in low visibility conditions after the airfield lighting had extinguished	the crew important visual cues
the aircraft 's ground speed	a safe taxi speed while back-taxiing on the runway
the tailwind and blowing snow on the runway	the illusion of relative movement
This	the aircraft ground speed inadvertently increasing to 35 knots
The first officer was unfamiliar with procedures for operating at uncontrolled aerodromes and in the use of ARCAL lighting and , as a result , the captain conducted both PF and PNF duties	his workload
The captain	the appropriate radio calls while manoeuvring the aircraft on the taxiways and prior to proceeding onto the runway
