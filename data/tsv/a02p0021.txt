rotational	engagement with a harder material
previous installation in a heli-coil repaired stud boss was initially suspected	Damage
installing	stainless steel inserts
the incident accessory support had the strengthened stud bosses	it is possible that the nose dome not have come loose , even with one damaged stud
The compressor stall was created by the dislodged dome disrupting the airflow into the engine	the engine was not capable of producing full thrust
distortion of the inlet flow field	Flames from the engine , seen by passengers in the aircraft , were likely the result of engine surges
engine	surges due to distortion of the inlet flow field
loss of the hold-down clamping force	The nose dome detached from the front accessory support
Installation of stud number one	damage to the thread of stud boss number one
The loss of clamping force at stud number one	a disproportionate load on studs two and four
studs two and four in the front accessory support	and
studs	the total hold clamping force
Possible scenarios	the type of thread damage observed on the stud include rotation of the stud while held in a vise or rotation of locking pliers around the threads of the stud
This modification	progressive stud boss thread wear
the dislodged dome disrupting the airflow into the engine	stall
