The reduced fuel flow was enough for the aircraft to become airborne ; however , with the continued high-power setting , the engine required more fuel than the restricted selector would allow	, the engine lost power
fuel selection was made to the left tank	the selector was most likely moved over the letter L and not engaged in the left tank detent
power was increased during the take-off roll	the required fuel flow was only available for a limited time
the aircraft was not equipped with a shoulder harness	the pilot 's upper body was allowed to move forward during the forced landing , resulting in injuries to his chest and forehead
fuel starvation	The engine lost power after take-off
No anomalies were found with the engine itself	the loss of engine power
The obstruction did	the loss of power
Because the aircraft was not equipped with a shoulder harness , the pilot 's upper body was allowed to move forward during the forced landing	injuries to his chest and forehead
the pilot 's upper body was	to move forward during the forced landing , resulting in injuries to his chest and forehead
The fuel selector was most likely set to the L and not in the detent	fuel flow
The use of a shoulder harness	the pilot 's injuries during the forced landing
the obstruction did	the engine power loss
