Without an altitude pre-select in the flight director , there was no independent aircraft cue to indicate descent below MDA	, the pilot continued to descend in controlled flight without adequate visual reference , unaware of the proximity of terrain , until the aircraft struck the water
During the latter stages of a non-precision instrument approach , the pilot lost situational awareness , specifically of his altitude	, he descended below the MDA and continued a controlled descent in IMC until the aircraft struck the water
the	weather was examined
the approach began	he was advised that the ceiling was unlimited
descending below the MDA	Although weather conditions were poor , they are not cause
crossing the fix	When he received the approach clearance he was close to the TILEL fix , at an altitude 1000 feet above the altitude cleared to
the speed and rate of descent been maintained	the aircraft would have crossed the VOKUB 5 DME fix at 1300 feet and reached MDA at 3 DME , 1 mile before the missed approach point
there was adequate visual reference , or to execute a missed approach if not	This have been an ideal location to permit transition either to maneouvre for a landing
The investigation considered the possibility that the pilot interpreted the 1000 foot altitude at VOKUB as a recommended altitude , consistent with the presentation in NACO approach plates , rather than a minimum altitude in accordance with Canada Air Pilot standards , and deliberately increased the rate of descent	achieve it
an altitude pre-select in the flight director	there was no independent aircraft cue to indicate descent below MDA
The wreckage examination revealed no indication of mechanical or electrical anomalies	the flight characteristics of the aircraft
The wreckage examination	no indication of mechanical or electrical anomalies
he continued	appropriate corrections up the loss of radar data , approximately 15 seconds before impact
The investigation , therefore , focussed on CFIT and on factors	the pilot to descend below MDA , apparently without being aware of the proximity of the terrain
Several factors identified	CFIT
The information available to the pilot was	the likelihood of a successful approach
a surface-based layer that may have been only 50 feet thick , based on reports from the preceding aircraft	surface beneath the approach path
The lake surface beneath the approach path was probably obscured by a surface-based layer that may have been only 50 feet thick	reports from the preceding aircraft
The increased rate of descent	N6058T crossing the VOKUB 5 DME fix at exactly the published 1000-foot minimum altitude , descending at 1200 feet per minute , a significantly greater rate of descent than necessary to reach MDA by the 2 DME missed approach point

A thin surface-based layer would be over 400 feet below the aircraft at MDA	the impression
surface-based fog	visual illusion
Factors	the loss of situational awareness were non-precision approach , poor visibility , rushed or incomplete checks , level of instrument proficiency and visual illusion created by surface-based fog
confusion	an unsafe approach
Minimum altitudes on Canada Air Pilot approach plates are presented differently from minimum altitudes on U.S. FAA/NACO approach plates	confusion and
