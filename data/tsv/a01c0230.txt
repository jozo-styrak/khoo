However , the instructor 's level of experience and his reply to the controller 's advisory suggest that he understood those words were issued as a caution	, the controller 's non-standard phraseology likely did not contribute to a possible wake turbulence encounter
Flight in a low-energy state at low altitudes greatly increases the difficulty of recovery from stalls or unusual attitudes	, although a simulated failure of the left engine was likely not the initiating factor of the control loss , it would have made recovery from an upset or stall at that altitude unlikely
Under the high cockpit workload conditions of engine failure training , it is likely that the pilots of C-FCNU did not comprehend the significance of the controller 's wake turbulence comment or , with understanding , did not see the need to take action to address the possibility of wake turbulence	they continued to fly the approach in a manner where wake turbulence from the preceding Airbus A320 aircraft was likely encountered
the absence of flight recorder information and pilot interviews and because many of the aircraft components were destroyed by a post-crash fire	it is difficult to draw definite conclusions with respect to the loss of aircraft control
the high impact forces or by being struck by flying debris inside the cockpit on impact	It is probable that the left mixture control and the left magneto switch were moved

they were operating VFR	the pilots of C-FCNU were solely responsible for wake turbulence avoidance
The absence of any communications advising ATC of an emergency situation	the likelihood an actual engine failure occurred

The light wind conditions	an ideal environment the persistence of wake turbulence
In the absence of other plausible reasons for the aircraft upset , the aircraft most likely encountered wake turbulence , which , at the low speed of the aircraft	a vortex-induced roll and loss of aircraft control from which the crew could not recover
