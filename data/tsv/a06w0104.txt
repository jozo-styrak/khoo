This rapidly degenerating condition placed the helicopter in a situation where the power required to fly exceeded the power available from the engine transmission system	, rotor performance and engine power limits were exceeded
The pilot had estimated the weight of the load on the helicopter because there was no system in place to provide helicopter pilots with actual firefighter crew and gear weights	, the take-off weight of the helicopter was underestimated by approximately 140 pounds and the helicopter was approximately 320 pounds over the HOGE chart limit of 2925 pounds
the recent passage of a thunderstorm through the area	the winds were easterly and shifting , with gusts ,
there was no system in place to provide helicopter pilots with actual firefighter crew and gear weights	The pilot had estimated the weight of the load on the helicopter
inaccurate estimates of the weights of the firefighters , their gear , and the equipment	The weight of the helicopter at take-off was incorrect
For the existing conditions , the take-off weight exceeded both the maximum gross weight limit	-LRB- HOGE -RRB- ceiling limit
There was no information of any pre-existing flight control or tail rotor drive system malfunction	a loss of tail rotor function
The pilot was experienced on Bell 206B helicopters , knowledgeable on the conditions	unanticipated right yaw , and familiar with the Nose Mountain landing area
the winds were gusting and variable in direction	directional control of the helicopter downwind as he hover-taxied to avoid the brush pile
This	reassurance a westerly take-off could be safely accomplished in the existing wind conditions
Avoidance of rotorcraft phenomena , such as URY , requires recognition of the conditions	an event and initiation of corrective action before experiencing the event
the helicopter to avoid the brush pile	the risk associated with the take-off
This	the take-off distance available and
This reduced the take-off distance available	it less likely that the helicopter would achieve translational lift speed in downwind conditions before reaching the escarpment
the presence of trees	a take-off to the east
a brush pile within the clearing	a take-off
a departure to the west	the tail of the helicopter within the critical relative wind azimuth area
This	the risk of URY
in the tailwind	the likelihood of the helicopter
the pilot	collective pitch
This rapidly degenerating condition	the helicopter in a situation
attempt	the helicopter turning
mechanism	helicopter pilots actual individual firefighter weights
there was no system in place	helicopter pilots actual firefighter crew and gear weights
These factors	the helicopter being operated outside its performance capabilities
Multiple small weight increments of personal items and equipment	a progressive and remarkable degradation the specification hover

This	the severity of his injuries
One blade of the two-bladed main rotor struck and penetrated the left cockpit and cabin during the accident sequence	the occupant injuries
height	the helicopter striking the terrain
below the helicopter	the pilot carrying out an uneventful landing and the helicopter rolled over on touchdown
The main rotor penetrated the left-side cockpit and cabin	the severity of the injuries to the passengers
this	the severity of his injuries
There was no system in place for the Alberta Ministry of Sustainable Resource Development Forest Protection Branch -LRB- ASRD-FPB -RRB-	helicopter pilots actual individual weights of fire crew and their personal gear
