The design of the radar processing system is such that the single action required for the deletion of track information from the coast list also deletes all flight plan information on the aircraft	, when the SSR target for C-GLJM was re-acquired , there was no flight plan information available to correlate with the new target
The presence of uncontrolled VFR targets below and surrounding the controlled airspace in the Toronto area may desensitize controllers to the presence of aircraft with which they are not in contact	, traffic information may not always be passed , under the assumption that these aircraft are not flying within controlled airspace
The radar target for C-GLJM was not recognized as conflicting traffic for JZA7868	, the flight crews of JZA7868 and C-GLJM were not issued traffic information or vectors to avoid each other
the Mode C altitude readout for C-GLJM was not functioning	there was no indication on the RSiT that this aircraft was flying at 6000 feet
the large number of transient VFR aircraft that ask for temporary radar services and by the generally short time that aircraft are in the sector	The east satellite sector relied heavily on radar
the target for C-GLJM was not shown as known radar traffic	it was not mentioned by the first east satellite sector controller nor was it matched with the flight progress strip
tracking active flights	The flight progress strips did not , therefore , serve as a back-up method
The practice of handing-off departing aircraft to subsequent controllers prior to the normal airspace boundaries meant that there was a tacit confirmation from the controller	the airspace that there was no known conflicting traffic for that departing aircraft
the identifying flight data was not displayed on the radar data processing system situation display -LRB- RSiT -RRB-	The aircraft was forgotten
deleting data from the coast list , without , at the same time , deleting the entire flight plan	There is no provision
the radar system re-acquired the secondary surveillance radar -LRB- SSR -RRB- target for C-GLJM	there was no flight data available to post in the target data block
no indication on the strip that C-GLJM	contact
The flight plan of C-GLJM was inadvertently deleted from the coast list	the loss of all displayed flight data for that target on the radar monitor
The method of conducting the change of responsibility briefing , by first referencing traffic on the radar monitor against flight progress strips	the flight being overlooked
The early handoff to the next sector	the assumption that unidentified targets in the vicinity would be at low level and of no concern to departing climbing aircraft such as JZA7868
