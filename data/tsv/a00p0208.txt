The crack in the spar of the failed rotor blade did not manifest itself through the outer skin because of the lack of bonding between the main-rotor blade spar and the outer skin	, the crack would not have been identifiable by visual inspection before the blade failure
the section of the blade was lost	a large imbalance was created in the rotor system leading to the failure of the lead and lag dampers
a lack of tail-rotor thrust	In an attempt to stop the helicopter from spinning , the pilot would likely carry out the emergency procedure for loss of yaw control
there would be no tail surface to resist the yaw	However , even after the pilot had closed the throttle to remove engine torque , the spinning would not stop quickly
the lack of bonding between the main-rotor blade spar and the outer skin	The crack in the spar of the failed rotor blade did not manifest itself through the outer skin
voids were found on these early blades	it was possible that there were more blades in the system that were susceptible to the same corrosion , fatigue cracking , and failure
the rotor system	the failure of the lead and lag dampers
The imbalance	extreme vibrations
There are two scenarios , either of which , or both	the main-rotor blades severing the tail section
The first scenario is that extreme vibrations compromised the tail-boom strength	the tail section
extreme vibrations	the tail-boom strength
the loss of a large portion of a main-rotor blade	such an imbalance the blades flew in an erratic and extreme path and struck the tail boom
In-flight loss of the tail section	the pilot to lose attitude control
the circular distribution of helicopter pieces and contents	spinning evident
The helicopter 's autorotation characteristics would have been destroyed by the loss and damage of the main-rotor blades	the rotors to stop before impact
visual inspection before the blade failure	the crack identifiable
Two thirds of one of the helicopter 's five main-rotor blades separated in flight , and one or two of the remaining main-rotor blades struck and severed the tail section in flight , all of	the helicopter uncontrollable
There was no bonding on part of the skin on the main-rotor blade that separated	corrosion pits form in the blade
