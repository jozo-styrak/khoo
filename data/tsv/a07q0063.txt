The attitude of the aircraft on impact and the marks on the ground indicate that the forces acting on the aircraft were directed toward the right	, it was concluded that the aircraft was banked right before it disappeared behind the trees
For that reason , it was concluded that the aircraft was banked right before it disappeared behind the trees	, it is reasonable to think that the pilot made a right turn after the low-altitude pass in order to continue on his route to Wabush
To determine the effect of the vortex generators on the stall angle of attack , the modified wings had to be compared with the original wings	showed that the difference between the two stall angles of attack was about 2
However , instead , the aircraft was in a slightly nose-up attitude , and the wreckage trail was over 250 feet long	, failure of a flight control is not very plausible
However , no wood residue was found in the wing , the right wing tip remained attached to the wing until the final impact , and the imprint could be the result of a propeller blade impact during the aircraft breakup	, it is not possible to conclude with certainty that the aircraft struck a tree
Analysis of the impact marks , the wreckage pattern and the imprints on the aircraft 's instruments3 indicates that the aircraft struck the frozen surface of the lake at a speed near the stall speed at an angle of descent consistent with the stall angle of attack of the aircraft	, it can be concluded that the aircraft was in a stall condition at the time of impact
the aircraft had been banked steeply to the left	aerodynamic forces have pushed it to the left of its flight path , that is , to the west of the lake
Therefore , it is reasonable to think that the pilot made a right turn after the low-altitude pass	continue on his route to Wabush
the flaps were retracted	it was concluded that the aircraft did not experience an asymmetrical flap problem
increasing	the stall angle of attack
the vortex generators	the stall angle of attack , the modified wings had to be compared with the original wings
the elevator failed	the result be a nose-down attitude and an increase in speed
that had happened	most debris be close to the point of impact
that had happened	the tree impact have caused the aircraft to yaw right and pitch down
the altitude at which the collision would have occurred	it is reasonable to think that the pilot would not have had time to regain control of the aircraft before it struck the frozen surface of the lake
a	propeller blade impact during the aircraft breakup
the pilot 's aim was to fly over the cottage of his friends	it is reasonable to think that the aircraft was flying below normal cruising speed
that were the case ,	the aircraft have experienced a loss of speed during the climb
the bank angle of the aircraft was 70	as was reported by one witness , the stall speed have increased from 67 knots to 115 knots
the stall occurred during the climb	the left wing stalled before the right wing
the time of the occurrence	the A ropro company operations manual did not make provision for the restrictions on daytime VFR flights prescribed in Section 703.27 of the Canadian Aviation Regulations
the aircraft was on a medical evacuation -LRB- MEDEVAC -RRB- flight	the company mistakenly advised the search and rescue centre that there were two pilots on board the aircraft when it was reported missing
no indication that weather	the accident
the pilot	a right turn after the low-altitude pass
an unidentified mechanical problem increased the pilot 's workload	him before the impact
an unidentified mechanical problem	the pilot 's workload
No anomalies were observed by the witnesses or noted on previous flights	a loss of control
failure of the ailerons or rudder	loss of control of the aircraft
This	the aircraft to strike the frozen surface of the lake at high speed with a steep angle of descent
the tree impact	the aircraft to yaw right and pitch down
a collision with a tree	the aircraft speed below the stall speed
Several factors	reducing the margin between the aircraft 's speed and its stall speed
Furthermore , the aircraft proximity to the ground could create an illusion of high speed	the pilot to reduce speed
the aircraft proximity to the ground	an illusion of high speed , which may have induced the pilot to reduce speed
pilot	speed
The aircraft was flying at an altitude	a collision with an obstacle and that did not allow time for recovery
The steep right bank of the aircraft	the aircraft 's stall speed
