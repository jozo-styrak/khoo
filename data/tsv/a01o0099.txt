corrective action	this leads to an aerodynamic stall of the rotor blades
the main rotor was fully stalled	When the low-rotor-rpm warning horn sounded and the throttle was opened , the engine did not respond
the low altitude	the pilots were unable to recover before the helicopter struck the ground
this	an aerodynamic stall of the rotor blades
As the occurrence helicopter was sinking , the upward rushing air continued to increase the angle of attack on the slowly rotating rotor blades	recovery virtually impossible
the upward rushing air continued	the angle of attack on the slowly rotating rotor blades
the stalled rotor blades	drag
a brake	the rotor rpm
he	the exercise to continue beyond the point from which a safe recovery could be achieved
During a practice autorotation , the helicopter 's main-rotor rpm was allowed to drop below safe limits	an aerodynamic stall of the main-rotor blades
the helicopter 's main-rotor rpm was	to drop below safe limits , leading to an aerodynamic stall of the main-rotor blades
The instructor pilot	the student pilot conduct a practice forced approach and autorotation into a field that was inappropriate for the exercise
the instructor	inadequate emphasis
