However , the existing white-out conditions deprived him of depth perception	, he did not see that the slope of the terrain exceeded the lateral limit for a safe landing
The pilot could not land rapidly because the slope of the terrain exceeded the aircraft 's critical roll angle	was that prolonged hovering must have exacerbated the snowball effect
It is highly likely that , in the operational and environmental conditions existing at the time , the helicopter pilot lost all visual reference with the ground	he could not perceive the lateral movement of the helicopter and could not keep his roll angle below the critical angle dictated by the maximum lateral deflection of the cyclic control
That is why he could not perceive the lateral movement of the helicopter and could not keep his roll angle below the critical angle dictated by the maximum lateral deflection of the cyclic control	, the aircraft pivoted about the left -LRB- uphill -RRB- skid , which was in contact with the ground , and rolled onto its side
the slope of the terrain exceeded the aircraft 's critical roll angle	The pilot could not land rapidly
their seat-belts were not fastened	the passengers risked serious injury in the event of an accident
the existing white-out conditions deprived him of depth perception	The pilot did not notice that the slope of the landing area exceeded the maximum roll angle allowable for this aircraft
the snowball effect and the ice on the aircraft 's windows prevented him from seeing external references	The pilot did not perceive the lateral movement of the helicopter
the aircraft came to rest on its left side	The survival equipment in the left baggage compartment was not accessible after the accident
the existing white-out conditions	him depth perception
During the vertical descent , the rotor wash blew powdery snow outward and upward	a snowball effect and
The result was	hovering
prolonged hovering	the snowball effect
The conditions inside the helicopter contributed further to a reduction in visibility ; frost on the side windows and the left windshield clearly restricted the pilot 's view	him seeing external reference points clearly
From this , it is clear that , although the service bulletin -LRB- 25.00.63 -RRB- recommending reinforcement of the front seats had not been executed on this helicopter	the injuries sustained by the front seat occupants
the maximum roll angle allowable for this aircraft because the existing white-out conditions	him depth perception
the lateral movement of the helicopter because the snowball effect and the ice on the aircraft 's windows	him seeing external references
Service bulletin 25.00.63 recommending reinforcement of the front seats had not been executed on this helicopter , but	the injuries sustained by the front seat occupants
