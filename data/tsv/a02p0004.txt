an error in format and was not issued until after the loss of communication occurred	This NOTAM was delayed
the delay in issuing the NOTAM	relevant information about the scheduled removal of the frequency was not entered into the controllers ' OIDS
the frequency was removed from service	the warning systems worked correctly
the controller had not provided alternate instructions	he had to rely on the aircrew to recognize that a communication failure had occurred
the clearance to turn was not received , and as their aircraft approached the localizer	they were preparing to contact the controller and , if necessary , turn to establish their aircraft on the localizer
such prior knowledge	warning about high terrain to the south of the localizer would have been dependent on the GPWS
no stated requirement that the controller	alternate instructions
However	their previous experience flying into Victoria
their knowledge of the local terrain	a level of safety not present under other circumstances
An active communication frequency was prematurely removed from service following a misunderstanding of a voice communication between technical staff	a loss of communications between the controller and WJA25
