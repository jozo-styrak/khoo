During the descent , the aircraft lost significantly less altitude than had been experienced by the manufacturer during controlled tests that simulated total engine failure	unlikely that the loss of engine power was total
it was concluded that the aircraft did not stall or spin before entering the descent	spin
impact	the aircraft was nearly rolled out of the bank
returning to over 400 fpm , indicating a recovery of engine power	increase
power degraded for a second time	the pilot most likely decided again to return to the airfield
impact	the propeller did not strike the engine pylon or the boom tube , indicating low vertical impact forces on initial contact with the mound of soft earth
The aircraft struck a concrete sewer casement , causing high deceleration and overloading the common attachment point of the seat and shoulder belts ,	the pilot struck the instrument panel and received fatal injuries
the aircraft	a turn , inconsistent with normal formation procedures or with the planned routine
the fuel system	a transitory degradation of engine performance
The resulting increase in aircraft stall speed would have made the airspeed less than 1.3 Vs	the performance deficit of the aircraft
The resulting increase in aircraft stall speed	the airspeed less than 1.3 Vs
However , the hull was penetrated when it struck the concrete sewer casement	a very high longitudinal deceleration
The resulting force overloaded the seat and shoulder belt attachment	the pilot striking the instrument panel
Discrepancies in the fuel system most likely allowed air into the fuel line	a partial loss of engine power
While the pilot was turning back toward the airport , the flaps were raised , probably inadvertently	an increased rate of descent
The aircraft struck a concrete sewer casement	high deceleration
