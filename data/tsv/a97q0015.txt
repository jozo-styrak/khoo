He did not consider it necessary to report the loss of control immediately , believing that he would be able to correct the turn ; subsequently , he was too preoccupied by the events to inform the pilot-in-command	, the pilot-in-command was deprived of information crucial to the flight
The announcements made after the aircraft began to drift were inaudible , non-standard , or non-existent : the co-pilot did not hear the statement V1 at 100 knots ; the co-pilot announced J'ai la vitesse I have reached the speed -RSB- instead of V1 , which the pilot-in-command did not hear ; and , the pilot-in-command did not announce that he was rejecting the take-off	, the crew members did not have the same understanding of what had to be done
the condition of the runway , the environmental conditions , and the late application of corrective measures	Because no pre-impact technical anomaly or mechanical failure that could have explained the aircraft 's drift to the left was identified , it appears that the loss of directional control was
no pre-impact technical anomaly or mechanical failure that could have explained the aircraft 's drift to the left was identified	it appears that the loss of directional control was due to the condition of the runway , the environmental conditions , and the late application of corrective measures
he had received simulator training that included take-off exercises in these conditions	he have been more conscious of the risks involved and that he would have performed the take-off himself
the pilot-in-command had the necessary qualifications	the co-pilot take off in an RVR of 1,200 feet
granted , at least in part	The fact that the pilot-in-command erroneously thought that the co-pilot had selected a V1 of 100 knots indicates that the instructions were taken
flight	the
he did not have an overall and accurate understanding of the situation	he could hardly make an effective decision
co-ordination	crew
he had had more time to analyse the situation	The pilot-in-command have reacted differently
the co-pilot had clearly and precisely communicated the loss of directional control of the aircraft and his intention to continue the take-off	It is possible that the pilot-in-command not have cut power
the emergency was so sudden	he had very little time to analyse the situation correctly
he pulled back on the control column	the aircraft clear the obstacles ahead
the co-pilot realized that he had lost directional control and that the aircraft had reached VR	he judged that if he pulled back on the control column , the aircraft would clear the obstacles ahead
the power had not been cut	Since the aircraft did not stall before settling into the snow , and there was no obstacle along its track , it is clear that the aircraft have continued its flight
existing regulations	contributed to the lack of cockpit coordination
the condition of the runway , the strong cross-wind ,	The loss of directional control was probably
he judged that if he pulled back on the column , the aircraft would take off and clear any obstacles	The co-pilot decided to continue the take-off
he believed that a collision with the snowbank on the runway edge was inevitable	The pilot-in-command decided to reject the take-off
the power had not been cut	The aircraft have continued its flight
the following factors	the pilot-in-command 's decision
A more elaborated briefing	the pilots plan the take-off in light of the existing conditions and to formulate a joint plan in case of emergency
This misunderstanding did	the accident , since the co-pilot initiated rotation at 100 knots , however , it indicates a lack of co-ordination even before the roll began
he	the turn
he	an effective decision
the power	a crash
power	the aircraft 's speed
According to company procedures and the agreements made in the preflight briefing , it was up to the co-pilot , as the PF	the decision to continue or reject the take-off when directional control was lost
he was the person in the best position	such a decision
The following factors , although not required by existing regulations	the lack of cockpit coordination
he wanted	the aircraft
the aircraft	the force of impact
