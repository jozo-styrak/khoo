pilots conduct flight operations that require focussing some of their attention on tasks that are not related to the safety of the flight , such as monitoring highway traffic and reporting	additional means of gathering air traffic information may be necessary to reduce the risk of midair collision
changing	the airspace structure so that the air route is in Class D airspace
he was experiencing no control problems	he decided not to land immediately and did not declare an emergency
control surfaces are damaged	extensive control movements can result in further damage or jammed controls
a number of factors combined	a significant risk of collision
Aircraft certified for single-pilot operation , including Cessna 337 's , are used in commercial air operations	a considerable amount of the pilot 's attention to be diverted from normal flying duties
A second pilot or mission specialist in the aircraft	the likelihood of seeing and avoiding other aircraft
A TCAS warning	the pilot adequate time
Minor changes to the route or airspace structure	pilots ' awareness of other air traffic in the corridor
Minor changes to the route or airspace structure could significantly enhance pilots ' awareness of other air traffic in the corridor	the risk of midair collisions
Mandatory reporting points and a radio frequency published in the CFS for the VFR route	pilots
no difficulty spotting them	the mandatory radio calls
The pilot of the Cessna 172	any physical damage to his aircraft
there had been a collision	the Cessna 172 pilot make informed decisions regarding landing problems and the declaration of an emergency
the Cessna 172 pilot	decisions regarding landing problems and the declaration of an emergency
extensive control movements	further damage or jammed controls
The see-and-be-seen principle of VFR separation has inherent limitations	positive separation
Neither aircraft was equipped with TCAS	the pilots a defence against collision
The Cessna 337 pilot 's verification that the rudders were free and clear through full travel and the consequent decision to not land as soon as possible	the risk of an in-flight control failure
