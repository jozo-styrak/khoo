the accident site was in shadow and , unlike the surrounding areas , was not forested	It is possible that the visual cues normally used to determine height above terrain were degraded
No mechanical malfunction was reported or found	engine power loss or a loss of flight control
The absence of a post-crash fire is likely due in part to the aircraft battery being ejected from the aircraft during the breakup sequence	an electrical spark igniting the fuel
no briefing was	regarding the forced-approach technique to be used on the accident flight
the aircraft was	the terrain
the high weight of the aircraft , the altitude , and the outside air temperature	performance
the cooling of air in shadowed areas	downdrafts
It is possible that downdrafts , caused by the cooling of air in shadowed areas and by snow on the ground at higher elevations in the mountains	the aircraft 's climb performance
The instructor did not brief the student on forced-approach procedures	the student continue the forced approach to a height from which the aircraft could not avoid rising terrain
Shadows and lack of visual cues , such as trees , in the area of the forced approach	the pilots ' ability to estimate the aircraft 's height above ground
