Radar scanning of Class E airspace to detect conflicting VFR traffic is not supported by aides , such as flight data strips , and these targets may only display as a splat without associated data tags	, determination of conflicting traffic requires an additional effort delegated to the controller 's memory
Transponders are required within Class C airspace , but are not required within basic Class E airspace	The safety advantage that might be gained with TCAS equipment installed in aircraft is limited within Class E airspace since TCAS systems operate on transponder signals
neither crew had been advised of the traffic	only the defence of un-alerted visual scanning remained
the helicopter received the descent clearance	the defence of altitude separation was removed
the Otter pilot intended to operate within Class C airspace	the transponder was turned on
either aircraft been equipped with TCAS	this incident
his attention was divided between numerous tasks related to his plan , causing his radar-scanning technique to deteriorate	The Victoria terminal controller did not detect the Otter 's presence , possibly
