The engine MM states that wear felt with the radius scribe is reason for rejecting and replacing the torquemeter gear , and Rolls-Royce indicated that the radius scribe will typically detect wear of 0.001 to 0.002 inch	, it could be concluded that the in-service wear limit would be 0.001 to 0.002 inch
The occurrence torquemeter gear had 0.004 inch wear , at least twice the in-service wear limit , and had failed at 4576 hours , 1076 hours beyond the MPI inspection requirement	The torquemeter gear failed of an undetected crack that progressed in fatigue
There is no requirement to track the time-in-service for the torquemeter gear , or for any of the other gears in the gearbox	, if a serviceable gear is installed during gearbox maintenance , it is possible that the gear 's time-in-service may not be determined
rejecting and replacing the torquemeter gear	The engine MM states that wear felt with the radius scribe is reason
the radius scribe will typically detect wear of 0.001 to 0.002 inch	for rejecting and replacing the torquemeter gear , and Rolls-Royce indicated
the gearbox is maintained on-condition , the gears could far exceed the 3500-hour MPI requirement	Rolls-Royce has also indicated that ,
an undetected crack that progressed in fatigue	The torquemeter gear failed
an MPI had been carried out on the torquemeter gear before its failure	it is likely that the crack would have been detected
the gearbox is already opened	However , the requirement to perform the MPI is based specifically on the time-in-service of the torquemeter gear , and then
a serviceable gear is installed during gearbox maintenance	it is possible that the gear 's time-in-service not be determined
the gears identified in CEB 72-6061 are not considered as mandatory replacements	operators can continue to use and install serviceable part number 6893673 torquemeter gears , although it is possible that the gear 's time-in-service may not be determined
an undetected crack that progressed in fatigue	The helical torquemeter gear failed
it is not mandatory to replace torquemeter gear part number 6893673 with the newly released torquemeter gear	it is possible that torquemeter gear part number 6893673 will experience premature wear and failure
The failure of the torquemeter gear	the loss of engine power to the helicopter 's transmission
In-service wear	torquemeter gear part number 6893673
The Rolls-Royce 250-C47B Operation and Maintenance Manual inspection requirements	the torquemeter gear and other gears installed in the gearbox to potentially exceed 3500 hours in service before a magnetic particle inspection -LRB- MPI -RRB- is carried out
other gears in the gearbox	their time-in-service
