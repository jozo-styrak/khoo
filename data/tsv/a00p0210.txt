Since most air taxi and commuter operators use their own aircraft rather than a simulator for pilot proficiency training , higher-risk emergency scenarios can only be practiced at altitude and discussed in the classroom	, pilots do not gain the benefit of a realistic experience during training
the	installation of the planetary gear oil strainer at overhaul
an annunciator system	monitoring of engine oil contamination is limited to the frequency and thoroughness of maintenance inspections
the inability of the rudder	Below Vmc , maintaining control of the aircraft -LRB- with the remaining engine at take-off power -RRB- becomes impossible
asymmetric thrust	The drag from the flaps and the windmilling propeller resulted in a continuing loss of airspeed and a progressive loss of rudder authority
a power loss	The AFM-recommended emergency procedure for rejecting a take-off
rejecting a take-off due to a power loss while airborne and below Vmc is to reduce power on the operating engine , sufficiently to assure control of the airplane , and land straight ahead	The AFM-recommended emergency procedure
the increasing drag of the extending	The airspeed was subsequently allowed to fall below Vmc , possibly
the airspeed fell below Vmc	any incremental reduction in power on the operating engine would have contributed to increased control as long as the airspeed did not decrease further
the installation at the last overhaul	The planetary gear oil strainer screen wires fractured by fatigue
power on the remaining engine not being reduced to relieve the asymmetric thrust condition until impact was imminent	Although airspeed was above Vmc at the time of the power loss , the aircraft became progressively uncontrollable

The fact that the aircraft remained upright and floating in daylight conditions contributed to the successful evacuation of the cabin without injury	about half of the passengers locate and don their life vests
