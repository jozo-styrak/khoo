the existing ambient temperatures	snow entering the stall warning system would probably have melted on contact , leaving the resulting water in the stall warning system
cooling	the stall warning system , allowing the water in the system to freeze during the station stop at Island Lake
the lift transducer vane tolerances in this particular aircraft resulted in a vane position normally in the wing stalled position when the aircraft was at rest	the vane would have frozen in that position during the station stop
the first officer believed that the aircraft might not be capable of flight	he called for a reject , even though the airspeed was beyond V1
the time required for recognition , decision , and reaction , engine power was reduced four seconds after rotation	The quick-reference speeds for V1 of 103 knots , and VR of 106 knots used by the crew , were slightly higher than those -LRB- 101 knots and 101 knots respectively -RRB- listed in the more-detailed reference in the AFM ;
the factors listed above , the crew used reverse thrust	both engines
increasing the rolling resistance increased the stopping distance by decreasing tire traction	thereby increasing the accelerate-stop distance of the aircraft by an undetermined amount
performance data were not available	the crew was not able to determine how much snow on the runway was acceptable for continued operation of the aircraft , or to what extent such snow and a slippery runway would affect the take-off and rejected take-off performance of the aircraft
After the system was turned off , no heat was provided to the system ; thereafter , the ambient airflow over the wing during the taxi from the runway to the ramp , and the ambient temperature , would have had the effect of cooling the stall warning system	the water in the system to freeze during the station stop at Island Lake
this particular aircraft	a vane position normally in the wing stalled position when the aircraft was at rest
it	them avoid the false stall warning after take-off
its	operating voltage
the wings were	lift and
engine power was	four seconds after rotation
The snow on the runway increased both the aircraft 's acceleration distance by increasing the rolling resistance , and increased the stopping distance by decreasing tire traction	the accelerate-stop distance of the aircraft by an undetermined amount
The snow on the runway increased both the aircraft 's acceleration distance by increasing the rolling resistance	the stopping distance by decreasing tire traction , thereby increasing the accelerate-stop distance of the aircraft by an undetermined amount
manufacturer	performance charts
such snow and a slippery runway	the take-off
The Beech 1900 stall warning test function does not detect a condition in the stall warning system	a false stall warning on take-off
Neither pilot received instruction on faults related to the stall warning system	a false stall warning
The reduced heat provided to the stall warning system during the short taxi time was	the ice
The pilots ' use of the cockpit quick reference take-off speed chart	slightly increased aircraft 's accelerate-stop distance
The higher-than-V1 speed from which engine power was reduced , together with the snow-covered runway conditions	the aircraft 's accelerate-stop distance
