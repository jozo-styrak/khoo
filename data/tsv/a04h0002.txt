the wind normally creates waves that make the initial contact with the water surface much more violent	Compared with a wheeled aircraft landing on a runway , the reduction of the water landing speed of a seaplane in high winds is doubly important
the risk of bird strike is high when flying over water at low altitude	it is possible that a bird strike occurred , causing a loss of control or sudden pilot incapacitation
Although the pilot appeared to be in good health	of the autopsy and toxicology testing do not indicate that his performance was degraded by physiological factors , the possibility of a sudden incapacitation can not be ruled out
the reduced range of the signal	In any event , the signal probably would not have been received
ensuring that the airworthiness directives applicable to their aircraft were completed	The owners of the aircraft did not know that they were responsible
six airworthiness directives had not been entered in the technical logs at the time of the last inspection	an examination of the components affected by these airworthiness directives was carried out
the left elevator has not been found	the possibility was considered that it separated from the aircraft in flight , causing handling problems
the airworthiness directives that had not been completed	The certificate of airworthiness was not in effect at the time of the accident
the reduced range of the signal once the ELT was submerged , which could have increased the response time of search and rescue units if there had been no witnesses to the accident	The distress signal emitted by the fixed , automatic emergency locator transmitter -LRB- ELT -RRB- was not received
This interval	a degradation of the pilot 's skills and decision-making process
decision	a flight after a seven-month hiatus , without making a training flight with an instructor ,
These two conditions help reduce the speed at which the aircraft touches the surface of the water	the landing run
These two conditions help	the speed at which the aircraft touches the surface of the water , thereby reducing the landing run
These two conditions	the speed at which the aircraft touches the surface of the water , thereby reducing the landing run
Compared with a wheeled aircraft landing on a runway , the reduction of the water landing speed of a seaplane in high winds is doubly important because the wind normally creates waves	the initial contact with the water surface much more violent
the wind	waves that make the initial contact with the water surface much more violent
An upwind approach	the initial impact , the length of the landing run and
The crash site is in a very wide section of the river	no shelter from the elements
was two miles east of its original position ; was in a section of the river	no protection from the elements
examination of the aircraft	no evidence of a pre-impact deficiency or engine or system malfunction
Since the risk of bird strike is high when flying over water at low altitude , it is possible that a bird strike occurred	a loss of control or sudden pilot incapacitation
the fact that a pilot from the approved maintenance organization	a ferry flight after the annual inspection
these airworthiness directives	an examination of the components
Since the left elevator has not been found , the possibility was considered that it separated from the aircraft in flight	handling problems
The distress signal emitted by the fixed , automatic emergency locator transmitter -LRB- ELT -RRB- was not received because of the reduced range of the signal once the ELT was submerged	the response time of search and rescue units
The pilot had not made a training flight with an instructor for more than 19 months	a degradation of his skills and decision-making process
