the pilot of C-FFHF had a mechanical problem with the aircraft	it that he would have communicated this information to the overflying aircraft
improving weather conditions	Since there is no evidence that there was a mechanical problem with the aeroplane , it is likely that the pilot flew C-FFHF into deteriorating weather conditions as he approached Goose Bay from the north , and that he landed on the pond to wait
inadequate daylight time remaining to complete the trip to Goose Bay	Any extended delay in departure from the pond would have required the pilot and passenger to spend the night there
the MAP gauge would then indicate field barometric pressure	The same indication would also be present if the engine was not operating ,
the poor visibility	Hg , and the propeller blade angle at low pitch , it is likely that the aircraft was configured for slow flight ,
shoulder	harnesses have provided increased protection for the occupants in this occurrence , they still provide more protection than lap belts alone
the pilot lost control of the aircraft in reduced visibility	The aircraft struck the water either during the pilot 's attempt to regain visual reference or
mechanical problems	There was no evidence to suggest that the pilot landed on a pond north of Goose Bay
the pilot	the decision to depart for Goose Bay
the visibility to the south was	the flight
shoulder harnesses	protection for the occupants in this occurrence
they	more protection than lap belts
the pilot was	visual reference with the surface sometime after take-off from the pond
The weather in the area at approximately the time of the occurrence was reported	visibility in snow showers with high winds
