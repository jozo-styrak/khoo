The pilot had not received adequate flight training for the red GOV light emergency and did not realize that the twist grip throttle still controlled fuel flow to the engine	, the emergency was mishandled , resulting in a severe overspeed of the aircraft 's dynamic components
However , during the approach , he did not carefully follow the flight manual procedures necessary to manage a red GOV light emergency : slight adjustments to fuel flow , and only apply small amplitude adjustments , synchronized with the collective pitch control	maintain Nr in the green range
returning the throttle to the FLIGHT detent	the pilot increased fuel flow , setting the fuel metering valve to the position it was in just prior to the illumination of the GOV light
normally received during the recommended factory training course	training provided to the occurrence pilot was less than
a proficiency or competency check was not conducted	there was no opportunity to verify the effectiveness of the training or the competency of their helicopter pilots
the pilot had been required to fly a competency check prior to the commencement of line operations	the deficiencies in flight training have been detected
the time of the occurrence	the RCMP Air Services operations manual did not require either a pilot proficiency check or a pilot competency check for their helicopter pilots , which would help detect deficiencies in flight training and any lack of proficiency
The descending turn and decreased collective masked the effect of the decreased throttle	too high a fuel setting for the flight regime
the pilot	fuel flow
This	the overspeed
The mishandling of the governor problem , and the lack of recall of any related in-flight training , suggests that the level of flight training the occurrence pilot received on governor failures was insufficient	him understand and respond appropriately to the red GOV light illumination
Consequently , the emergency was mishandled	a severe overspeed of the aircraft 's dynamic components
At the time of the occurrence , the RCMP Air Services operations manual did not require either a pilot proficiency check or a pilot competency check for their helicopter pilots	deficiencies in flight training
