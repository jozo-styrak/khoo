evident by the droop stop and teeter stop/bumper damage	unload
stops and bumpers from both blades were damaged	it was concluded that some of this damage occurred before one of the main-rotor blades separated
some point	the elastomeric bumpers fell out allowing the main-rotor to teeter excessively and overload the pitch change rod associated with the separated main-rotor blade
and the pilot 's body was ejected through the windshield into the path of the remaining main-rotor blade	loosen
it had remained in operation for more than 700 hours beyond its time limit before removal	There was extensive wear and tear on the freewheel unit sprag clutch , likely
The turbulence , specifically a down draught	the rotor system
the rotor system it was	the main-rotor blades to flap and teeter
the elastomeric bumpers fell out	the main-rotor teeter excessively and overload
The pitch change rod broke	loss of control of the rotor system and the helicopter
The blade pitched down	aerodynamic forces bend it
The deformation of the cabin fire wall	the pilot restraint system loosen
the in-flight break-up	illumination of the MR CHIP detector caution light
the main-rotor system	damage that led to the helicopter becoming uncontrollable
The helicopter encountered turbulent air that unloaded the main-rotor system resulting in damage	the helicopter becoming uncontrollable
Gross imbalance	deformation of the attachment area of the main-rotor transmission
