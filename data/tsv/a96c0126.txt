Photographs taken by Ministry of Natural Resources employees were reviewed to complement witness reports	, this analysis will not include the discussion of technical issues other than carburettor icing
The fuel mixture of 100 low-lead aviation gasoline and MOGAS significantly increased this risk	, the engines ' near simultaneous partial power loss was probably caused by carburettor ice , as reported by the pilot
witnesses provided enough information to be able to determine the nature of the accident	Investigators did not visit the accident site
staying	at low altitude and looking for a clear horizon beneath the cloud base
the pilot did not fully understand how the other aircraft had diverted around the marginal weather area	the pilot was expecting to find better weather ahead
the heavy rain was encountered	the pilot
the pilot did apply carburettor heat	there was not sufficient time to clear the carburettor ice and restore engine power before contact with the trees
It is possible that the refraction effect of the rain on the windscreen led the pilot to believe that the aircraft was higher than it actually was	, the pilot flew at an altitude that left no margin for dealing with emergency situations
the rain	the windscreen
the refraction effect of rain on the windshield	The pilot may have been at a lower level than anticipated
The aircraft fuel mixture consisted of aviation gasoline and MOGAS	was more susceptible to carburettor icing than aviation fuel alone
carburettor ice	The engines lost partial power , likely
the accident site because witnesses	enough information
witnesses provided enough information	the nature of the accident
Weather information from Sioux Lookout	to confirm the kind of weather that the pilot encountered
The remoteness of the site	ground access difficult
The fuel mixture of 100 low-lead aviation gasoline and MOGAS	this risk
carburettor ice	the engines ' near simultaneous partial power loss
the refraction effect of the rain on the windscreen	the pilot to believe that the aircraft was higher than it actually was and consequently , the pilot flew at an altitude that left no margin for dealing with emergency situations
The mounting of the first aid kit	the pilot removing it quickly from the aircraft when the survivors abandoned the aircraft
The location of the survival kit behind the baggage	the survivors removing the kit when exiting the aircraft and the kit was destroyed in the post crash fire
The temperature and dew point at the time of the accident	serious carburettor icing at any power setting
The location of the first aid and survival equipment	their quick removal during the rapid egress the aircraft
