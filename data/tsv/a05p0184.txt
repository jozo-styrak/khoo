The pilot did not indicate any problem with the aircraft longitudinal control	, it is unlikely that a trim runaway occurred or contributed to this accident
for the loss of control and the corresponding tail drop could not be determined	It should be noted that , because the helicopter flew a short distance from the pickup site before striking terrain , some degree of engine power was likely available after the tail rotor strike
Due to the severity of the post-crash fire , the reason for the loss of control and the corresponding tail drop could not be determined	of the damage to the helicopter , there was insufficient physical evidence to explain what caused the loud bang before the tail strike
the severe post-crash fire , continuity and functionality of the collective and cyclic pitch	However ,
the damage to the engine and accessory components	it could not be determined if there was a power loss
the helicopter flew a short distance from the pickup site before striking terrain , some degree of engine power was likely available after the tail rotor strike	It that ,
the severity of the post-crash fire , the reason for the loss of control	and the corresponding tail drop could not be determined
the damage to the helicopter	there was insufficient physical evidence to explain what caused the loud bang before the tail strike
this two-hour response time	rescue of the pilot was completed faster using local resources
JRCC Victoria taken control of the situation on initial notification	it is likely that it would have used similar local resources to rescue the pilot
the previous hard landing and rollover or the subsequent repair	this accident
the engine was	power at impact
control of the aircraft	a tail strike
a malfunction of the cyclic or collective pitch controls	the pilot to lose control of the aircraft resulting in a tail strike
The nature of a toe-in procedure	the tips of the skids to act as a pivot point for the helicopter
any momentary loss of engine power or reduction in main rotor torque	the tail to drop rapidly and the helicopter to yaw nose left-tail right
Control of the helicopter at this point would be difficult to regain and	the terrain
Control of the helicopter was lost and	the terrain
This	an intense post-crash fire
