Although Raytheon Aircraft issued communiques in 1989 and 1990 stating that the internal lubrication -LRB- actuator repack -RRB- was no longer required in ATA 5 , the King Air 100 and 200 Maintenance Manuals were not amended	, the procedure in the King Air 200 Maintenance Manual , which refers to disassembly and lubrication , could result in maintenance personnel following a procedure that was no longer required or recommended
of the lack of lubrication could not be determined	The nose landing gear actuator failed prematurely due to excessive wear of the nut assembly as a result of lack of lubrication
lubrication	the steel screw , under load and moving through the aluminum-bronze alloy insert , would produce a high wear rate resulting in premature failure
removing the nut from the actuator and cleaning away the grease during a field inspection , grease propagating from the nut , or incorrectly filling the nut with grease during overhaul	It could not be determined if the lack of lubrication was
lack of lubrication	The nose landing gear actuator failed prematurely due to excessive wear of the nut assembly
excessive wear of the nut assembly as a result of lack of lubrication	The nose landing gear actuator failed prematurely
a high wear rate	premature failure
Without lubrication , the steel screw , under load and moving through the aluminum-bronze alloy insert	a high wear rate resulting in premature failure
lack of lubrication	excessive wear of the nut assembly and premature failure
differences between the King Air 100 and 200 Maintenance Manuals	inconsistent maintenance practices
Therefore , the procedure in the King Air 200 Maintenance Manual , which refers to disassembly and lubrication	maintenance personnel following a procedure that was no longer required or recommended
This	inconsistent maintenance practices , despite the fact that Raytheon published communiques in 1989 and 1990 stating that internal lubrication of the actuators was no longer required
