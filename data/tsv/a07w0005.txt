Without his own set of charts , the captain was not able to confirm the information critical to the safe conduct of the approaches	, the crew used a DH value that was rounded down 54 feet lower than the published value
blowing snow in the high winds	Flight visibility would have deteriorated as the aircraft descended below the DH of 200 feet agl
the flap setting was increased from 20 to 35 in the final stage of the approach	the aircraft would have become destabilized
the captain would have had to pitch the nose down	maintain a stable airspeed to keep the approach lights in view
the first officer announced that the approach lights were visible at about 300 feet agl	the captain discontinued his instrument scan and decided to land
the captain 's late call for full flap	The first officer anticipated calling airspeeds in relationship to Vref , and since the Vref value had changed
the Vref value had changed due to the captain 's late call for full flap	he turned his attention to a reference card clipped to the instrument panel
one of the pilots been monitoring the instrumentation to touch down in a PMA	it is probable that the significant deviation below the optimum glide slope would have been noticed and corrected before ground contact short of the runway
conduct of the approaches	the safe
his own set of charts	the captain was not able to confirm the information critical to the safe conduct of the approaches
a hot microphone installed and used in the aircraft is expected to be recording continuously	As such , the CVR system did not meet serviceability standards required by the CARs
the instrument landing system -LRB- ILS -RRB- approach downward , and did not apply a cold temperature correction factor	The crew rounded the decision height -LRB- DH -RRB- figure
The captain , as pilot flying	difficulty
the captain was	the information critical to the safe conduct of the approaches
the information	the safe conduct of the approaches
the combination of these two factors	a descent of 74 feet below the DH of 200 feet agl on an approach to minimums and an increased risk of undershoot
the experience level from the pairing of the two pilots	the decision making , and the execution of the approaches
a further failure in recording of the first officer 's intercom channel	a loss of direct access to the first officer voice information
Although useable information was derived through other	and the quality of the occurrence investigation have been reduced
A late full flap selection at 300 feet above ground level -LRB- agl -RRB- likely destabilized the aircraft 's pitch attitude , descent rate and speed in the critical final stage of the precision approach	an increased descent rate before reaching the runway threshold
the crew	deviation below the optimum glide slope in low visibility unnoticed
The combined error	a descent of 74 feet below the DH on an ILS approach to minimums
