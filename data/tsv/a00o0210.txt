of the restriction in the elevator control system had to be something subtle and transitory	There was no binding or indication of any previous binding in the elevator system , nor was there an indication of any damage to any part of the elevator system
the aircraft landed	the elevator control system was functioning normally
the push-to-talk cord was wrapped loosely around the control column , a single loop could snag on the cabin air control knob , and the electrical cord would	restrict the aft movement of the control column
the control column was pulled back	the cord would remain snagged and tighten on the knob
The action of pushing the control column forward	a loosely wrapped electrical cord
During the landing approach , when the control column was moved forward to compensate for the flap selection , the tension on the cord would have relaxed	the cord to swing free of the air control knob
