During this attempt , the turn radius was smaller and the speed slower than in the first circuit , allowing the aircraft to come closer to the pass	most likely that during the second attempt to investigate the pass , the pilot slowed the aircraft and , when he decided to abort flight through the pass , turned sharply to avoid the higher terrain on the north side
It is therefore most likely that during the second attempt to investigate the pass , the pilot slowed the aircraft and , when he decided to abort flight through the pass , turned sharply to avoid the higher terrain on the north side	, the pilot was forced to turn left in a more confined area and would have applied greater bank angle in the turn to avoid the steep terrain
In addition , heavier cargo items would have been free to migrate during the impact sequence and become projectiles , increasing the level of injury to the occupants	forces alone were not survivable
Basic weight and balance of the aircraft was incorrectly recorded in several aircraft documents , leading to remarkable discrepancies in take-off weight and CG calculations	, a pilot could not calculate an accurate weight and balance
incorrect values were used for the aircraft basic weight and passenger weight -LRB- errors of 275 and 185 pounds respectively -RRB- , any weight and balance calculation would consistently have been approximately 450 pounds less than actual	Furthermore ,
unsuitable weather conditions	The pilot abandoned his attempt to fly through the pass
the	existing aft CG and likely increased the level of injury to the occupants
No mechanical conditions were identified	this accident
Although the valley was oriented predominately north-south , the pass at the south end of the valley had to be crossed in an east-west direction	it impossible for a pilot see through the pass until the aircraft was in it
During this attempt , the turn radius was smaller and the speed slower than in the first circuit	the aircraft to come closer to the pass
the pilot	the aircraft
The aircraft weight exceeded the certificated MAUW , and the CG was outside the floatplane aft limit , the latter being a condition known to hasten the onset of stall	challenging aircraft attitude changes
aircraft attitude changes	recovery difficult
The steep and rapid turn in slow flight	the Beaver to stall
The Alaska cargo door installation	the volume of the cargo compartment
This increase was conducive to larger loads being stowed farther aft	possible overloading of the cargo compartment
This increase was	larger loads being stowed farther aft , resulting in possible overloading of the cargo compartment
Unrestrained cargo likely shifted during this manoeuvring and exacerbated the out-of-limit CG	control even more difficult
Unrestrained cargo shifted during this manoeuvring	the out-of-limit CG
In addition , heavier cargo items would have been free to migrate during the impact sequence and become projectiles	the level of injury the occupants
He flew into a confined area that required him to manoeuvre the aircraft aggressively to avoid the rising terrain	the aircraft to stall
The out-of-limit weight and balance aggravated aerodynamic stall	rapid and uncontrolled aircraft attitudes from which the pilot could not recover before striking the trees
Basic weight and balance of the aircraft was incorrectly recorded in several aircraft documents	remarkable discrepancies in take-off weight and CG calculations
The practice of using a non-standard passenger weight	inaccurate take-off weight calculations and provided aan estimated total passenger weight that was 185 pounds less than actual
The practice of using a non-standard passenger weight led to inaccurate take-off weight calculations	aan estimated total passenger weight was 185 pounds less than actual
This weight and balance combination	the aircraft outside the manufacturer 's original design envelope
Such cargo movement would have exacerbated the effects of the existing aft CG	the level of injury the occupants
Such cargo movement	the effects of the existing aft CG
The Alaska cargo door installation	the volume of the cargo compartment
The installation is	larger loads being stowed farther aft and possible overloading of the cargo compartment
