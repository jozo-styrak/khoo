The take-off flight path chosen was shorter than the usual flight path used by local pilots	, the flight path for the initial climb before clearing the obstacles was shorter
Thus , the flight path for the initial climb before clearing the obstacles was shorter	, at a given point , the aircraft was not as high over the obstacles as it should have been if the take-off run had been started at the far end of the lake
speed increased , reducing the aircraft climb angle and extending the flight path for the climb	The stall could thus be due to a combination of these factors , which reduced the difference between the aircraft 's speed and the stall speed in conditions that were conducive to optical illusions created by drift and resulting from flying towards rising terrain
After turning into the tailwind , the ground speed increased , reducing the aircraft climb angle and extending the flight path for the climb	, climbing performance was reduced
After becoming airborne , the aircraft should have made a 60 left turn towards the saddle at the south end of the lake	be able to continue the turn over the lowest terrain
a combination of these factors , which reduced the difference between the aircraft 's speed and the stall speed in conditions that were conducive to optical illusions created by drift and resulting from flying towards rising terrain	The stall could thus be
the wind	the aircraft 's performance
Examination of the wreckage	no deficiencies , engine failure or aircraft system failure
no evidence that incapacitation	the pilot 's or passenger 's
the autopsy performed on the front seat passenger	the presence of coronary heart disease
the aircraft	a 60 left turn towards the saddle at the south end of the lake
a 60 left turn towards the saddle at the south end of the lake in order	the turn over the lowest terrain
The left turn put the aircraft in tailwind conditions at low altitude	the aircraft heading towards higher terrain than if it had been flown towards the saddle
It is possible that these conditions caused the pilot flying to increase the aircraft 's attitude	the aircraft speed
these conditions	the pilot flying to increase the aircraft 's attitude , thereby inadvertently decreasing the aircraft speed
the pilot flying	the aircraft 's attitude
drift	optical illusions
The stall could thus be due to a combination of these factors	the difference between the aircraft 's speed and the stall speed in conditions that were conducive to optical illusions created by drift and resulting from flying towards rising terrain
the stall speed in conditions	optical illusions created by drift and resulting from flying towards rising terrain
After turning into the tailwind , the ground speed increased	the aircraft climb angle and
a lack of familiarity with the area	the pilot flying to underestimate the distances and effect of the wind on the aircraft 's performance
The collision with the trees	a fuel leak in the right tank
drift	optical illusions
conditions	optical illusions created by drift
