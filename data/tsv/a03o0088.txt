There had been frost during the previous night , and although no one apparently saw frost on the aircraft lifting surfaces before or after the accident , there is no plausible condition other than frost contamination that would explain this accident	concluded that there was frost on the aircraft 's lifting surfaces when the aircraft took off
The combined effects of illusion of higher than actual airspeed during a low-altitude turn to downwind and reduced longitudinal stability due to frost on the wing negated usual cues that would alert the pilot to the slow speed	, the pilot was likely unaware that the aircraft was slowing down
a broom is not likely	to remove all frost adhering to the metal surface
the aircraft stalled	it entered a spin , uncharacteristic of this airplane
The normal climb speed for the aircraft was 70 to 80 KIAS	, factors that likely contributed to the aircraft slowing down were examined
the turn to downwind , there may have been an illusion of increasing speed that masked a decrease in airspeed	The aircraft height was lower than normal for a turn after take-off , and ,
frost on the wing would reduce the nose-down pitch tendency normally associated with reducing airspeed , removing a further cue to the pilot	Reduced longitudinal stability
10 of flap was used for take-off in accordance with the POH	flap retraction create a nose-up pitching moment and reduce the margin to the stall

The investigation focussed on understanding the factors that , together	the aircraft stalling without the pilot taking corrective action , dropping a wing in a manner uncharacteristic of the aircraft type as certified , and entering a spin
It also acknowledges that there are circumstances	it difficult to perceive the presence of contamination
Frost contamination of the wing upper surface would cause the loss of approximately 19 % of maximum lift coefficient	the stall speed in the turn being approximately 67 KIAS rather than 60 KIAS
Frost contamination of the wing upper surface	the loss of approximately 19 % of maximum lift coefficient , which would result in the stall speed in the turn being approximately 67 KIAS rather than 60 KIAS
frost contamination	drag
drag caused by frost contamination	a reduced rate of climb
Frost on the wings	a higher than normal stall speed
The normal climb speed for the aircraft was 70 to 80 KIAS ; therefore , factors	the aircraft slowing down were examined
During the turn , the aircraft experienced a tail wind that was increasing with height	a negative performance wind shear , which tended to reduce the airspeed
greater than normal drag	the aircraft slowing and not gaining as much height as predicted by the POH
The presence of frost on the wing	greater than normal drag and

The higher angle of attack required to produce lift with a contaminated wing	the pitch attitude

Reduced longitudinal stability due to frost on the wing	the nose-down pitch tendency normally associated with reducing airspeed , removing a further cue to the pilot

There was frost contamination on the upper surface of the wing that was either undetected or incompletely removed , degrading the aerodynamic performance of the wing	a stall without warning
