there been a requirement in the checklist to confirm the correct positioning of the elevator trim for take-off	the chance of taking off with it incorrectly set would be minimized
The very strong nose-up pitching moment that occurred at lift-off took the pilot by surprise	the aircraft stalling aerodynamically at a height from which recovery was not possible
this considerable force in time	the pitch-up and stall
the pilot	and
the elevator trim setting	the already strong nose-up pitching moment
Information provided by the aircraft manufacturer indicates this flap setting	the already strong nose-up pitching moment induced by the elevator trim setting
The elevator trim tab was set halfway between the neutral -LRB- take-off -RRB- position and full nose-up on the cockpit indicator	a very strong nose-up pitching moment at lift-off
full nose-up on the cockpit indicator , which resulted in a very strong nose-up pitching moment at lift-off	the aircraft to stall aerodynamically at a height from which recovery was not possible
