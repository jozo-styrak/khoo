The ultimate fear of any maintenance professional -LRB- supervisor , AME , apprentice , or inspector -RRB- is that an error , once committed , will remain undiscovered and ultimately lead to an accident	of an error in the installation/rigging of flight or engine controls is recognized by both the industry and Transport Canada , thus engine or flight control maintenance is treated differently than other maintenance tasks
hooking the cables up backwards	This analysis will focus on how five aircraft maintenance professionals -LRB- with different levels of experience -RRB- worked on this system and allowed the aircraft to be dispatched with the elevator trim operating backwards
The maintenance manual contains detailed instructions on how to remove and install the elevator and how to remove and install the stabilizer , but does not provide instruction for the task of removing and installing the stabilizer with the elevator attached	, a significant amount of interpretation is required
When the AME was conducting the final inspection of the installation , he was working alone	, he relied on operating the trim and checking the movements of the surfaces
an	error in the installation/rigging of flight or engine controls is recognized by both the industry and Transport Canada , thus engine or flight control maintenance is treated differently than other maintenance tasks
occurrence	the
that shift work	human performance
assigning and supervising the work of six apprentices that night , a task that would require maximum alertness and awareness on his part	The crew chief was simultaneously responsible
he connected the control cables	the crew chief had no objective cues to help him decide which cable ends should be attached together
The two apprentices completed the tasks as they thought they had been assigned ; they did not feel	the overall installation
nor did he appreciate the significance of rigging the controls	do
the personnel received	this occurrence is the quality and quantity of training
the apprentices had informed him	Since the continuous and progressive training of the apprentices is not a formal process , he would have been aware
This person would approach the inspection with fresh eyes	he would see errors overlooked by the person who actually performed the work
his signature indicates that	he is taking on responsibility for work which he did not complete
a second person to assist him , on this aircraft	it was more difficult to adequately check either the range of travel or the sense of operation
the aircraft began to pitch nose-up during the take-off run	the crew misdiagnosed the problem as one associated with the aircraft C of G rather than the trim setting
five weeks and were on the second and third nights of a four-night block	The crew had been working the night shift
the crew chief did not identify the elevator trim cables	The elevator trim cables were crossed during the installation
the AME was conducting the final inspection of the installation	he was working alone
, after midnight , the airport relies on the municipal fire department for crash fire rescue	Airport ERS were not available for the landing
Aviation maintenance professionals require an extremely broad range of skills , and they are subjected to the pressures of keeping all aircraft in revenue service , working during evening hours under severe time constraints , maintaining an ageing fleet , and dealing with other factors	human performance
The requirement for a second person to formally inspect this work is intended	the aircraft being dispatched with control problems
five aircraft maintenance professionals -LRB- with different levels of experience -RRB- worked on this system	the aircraft be dispatched with the elevator trim operating backwards
the crew chief	two apprentices complete it without direct continuous supervision
Fatigue	it more difficult for them to view the project as a whole , compared to the relative ease of viewing and completing a single task
fatigue and/or complacency	a number of relatively minor errors in installation , which the lead hand identified during his first inspection
the crew chief had no objective cues	him decide which cable ends should be attached together
it	the apprentices were working on the installation from gaining an overall picture of the work being carried out
the company	adequate technical training licensed AMEs
The captain 's inexperience on type , combined with the crew 's predisposition toward a C of G problem related to a load shift	the crew incorrectly diagnosing the trim problem
