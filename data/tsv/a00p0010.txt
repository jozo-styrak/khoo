the engine oil temperature gauge indicated normal operating temperatures after its installation	It is unlikely that the air-flow reduction plate installed on the oil cooler to increase oil temperature affected the engine adversely ,
an accumulation of water-absorbing material migrated out from refuelling gear fuel filters and subsequently obstructed the fuel passages to the combustion section of the engine	The helicopter lost engine power
The engine fuel injection tube and the wheel assembly contained a contaminant that obstructed the fuel flow	the engine to lose power
the use of anti-icing additives	water-absorbing cartridges
differential pressure across the filtering element	the water-absorbing media
The migration contaminated the fuel supply to the engine , obstructed the fuel flow ,	a loss of power
