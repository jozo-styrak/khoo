At the time of the incident , traffic in the west sector was light , with low complexity , involving regular flight routes	possible that the relatively benign traffic environment contributed to the west sector controller being less vigilant than normal
It is significant that the west sector controller could not recall noticing the progress of CDN4 and ASA131 after issuing the descent clearance to CDN4	, it is probable that the conversation distracted the west controller from his primary tasks and compromised his ability to monitor the progress of traffic under his control
the time of the incident	traffic in the west sector was light , with low complexity , involving regular flight routes
CDN4 reported in descent from FL350	the west sector controller did not annotate the flight progress strip for CDN4 , as required by ATC MANOPS
the location of ASA131	and the altitude of CDN4 were less precisely defined
The controller	the west sector was engaged in a non-operational conversation with a controller sitting adjacent to him
participating in a conversation involves a cognitive workload , it follows that the west sector controller was less able to attend to his primary task	However ,
the relatively benign traffic environment	the west sector controller being less vigilant than normal
The ASA131 strip appeared under the Victoria header , whereas the CDN4 strip appeared under the Tofino header	a conflict between the two aircraft less apparent
In short , the west sector controller did not properly annotate the flight strips for CDN4 and ASA131	the probability of a conflict being detected by reference to the flight progress board
the conversation distracted the west controller from his primary tasks	his ability to monitor the progress of traffic under his control
the conversation	the west controller from his primary tasks
The west sector controller did not properly annotate the flight strips for CDN4 and ASA131	the probability of a conflict being detected by reference to the flight progress board
This conversation distracted him from his primary task	his ability to monitor the progress of traffic under his control
This conversation	him from his primary task
policy	air traffic controllers engaging in non-essential and potentially distracting activities while controlling aircraft
