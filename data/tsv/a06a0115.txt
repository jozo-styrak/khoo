The missing check valve springs were not recovered and it could not be determined how long they had been missing	of a missing check valve spring would go unnoticed during normal operation of the system and , therefore , could go undetected for some time
Although the left air conditioning system continued to operate and supply the cabin/cockpit with air pressure , the pressure supplied was insufficient to overcome the rate of pressure loss created by the left system duct leak	, the cabin altitude could not be controlled and continued to climb
either of the two packs goes off-line	the remaining pack will automatically switch to Hi flow as a normal function of the system
the missing spring	However , the check valve remained open
the detached PRSOV line	This allowed cabin air pressure to backflow through the inoperative right system ducting up to the PRSOV valve which had closed
the bulkhead check valve spring been in place	the valve would have closed when the duct pressure opposing it decreased
a missing	check valve spring would go unnoticed during normal operation of the system and , therefore , could go undetected for some time
the independent technical	failures across both independent ACU pack systems resulted in a loss of cabin pressurization
there were little or no air pressure entering the aircraft cabin , provided the following conditions are met	According to Bombardier analysis from other incidents , the rate of pressure loss in this case was the same as what be expected
the lack of any other significant pressurization warnings and because the aircraft can normally operate on one pack	the crew 's initial plan to descend to 25 000 feet was reasonable
the detached left air conditioning unit pack system air supply duct , the detached right system pressure regulating shut-off valve line , and the missing return spring	the left system bulkhead check valve resulted in the loss of cabin pressurization
the detached left air conditioning unit pack system air supply duct , the detached right system pressure regulating shut-off valve line , and the missing return spring	the left system bulkhead check valve resulted in the loss of cabin pressurization
The closed PRSOV valve	the right pack
In this case the left pack did switch to Hi flow	the pressure in that respective duct system
The additional pressure from the Hi flow	an already weak flange-to-duct joint
Normally , one air conditioning pack operating at Hi flow is adequate for aircraft pressurization	a maximum aircraft altitude of 25 000 feet is maintained
the fact that a low airflow supply to the instrument panel and to the avionics bay	an increased operating temperature of those particular components
This	cabin air pressure backflow through the inoperative right system ducting up to the PRSOV valve which had closed due to the detached PRSOV line
This	backflow of the pressurizing air to the PRSOV valve
The left system duct had detached at the water separator	the majority of supply air from the left ACU escape from the ducting
the left system duct leak	the rate of pressure loss
The combined effect of the independent technical failures across both independent ACU pack systems	a loss of cabin pressurization
According to Bombardier analysis from other incidents , the rate of pressure loss in this case was the same as what could be expected if there were little or no air pressure entering the aircraft cabin	the following conditions are met
the missing return spring on the left system bulkhead check valve	the loss of cabin pressurization
the missing return spring on the left system bulkhead check valve	the loss of cabin pressurization
