There were no mechanical failures that contributed to the occurrence	, the analysis will focus on the awareness of runway conditions , the runway touchdown point , the delay in wheel braking , and the reduction in aircraft deceleration
The fact that the latest weather observation was a special report and was reporting snowfall should have alerted the crew that weather conditions had changed	the runway selected for landing may be contaminated
stopping the aircraft	This brake application occurred 2000 feet after the touchdown point , leaving only 4800 feet of runway available
There were no mechanical failures	the occurrence
the reduced stopping distance available	the chance of the aircraft
the initial rate of deceleration	the aircraft before the runway end
this	the available stopping distance
The contaminated runway surface condition	the distance required to stop the aircraft
the remaining runway	the overrun
