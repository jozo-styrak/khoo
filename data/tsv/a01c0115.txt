The NADSs and NSITs in the area control centres do not pass information electronically	, the NU controller did not have a means of checking the rerouting of SAS938 even though the information was entered correctly into the Winnipeg NADS
The supervisor spent a significant amount of time performing control duties , reducing the time available for making informed supervisory decisions	, available controllers were prematurely released from duty
the traffic flows	With fewer staff , the supervisor had less time to spend in decision making
radar	greater separation standards have to be applied
The geographic reporting system was used because of the lack of radar	, the time required for the NU controller to detect and correct the problem was about 1 hour 40 minutes
making informed supervisory decisions	The supervisor spent a significant amount of time performing control duties , reducing the time available
Task saturation	his communication with the NU controller
The workload accepted by the TL supervisor and the handoff performed by the TL controller started the process	the eventual loss of separation of SAS938 and KLM602
a lack of a direct pilot-to-controller communications capability	activities were hampered
The NU controller 's confirmation activities were	and
The lack of automatic electronic data transfer between ACC NADS and NSiT display computers	controller workload as aircraft move from sector sector
The absence of air traffic control radar and direct pilot-to-controller communications	the NU controller detecting the true position of SAS938 for about 1 hour 25 minutes and delayed the implementation and confirmation of corrective action for about 1 hour 40 minutes
