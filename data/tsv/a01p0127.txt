the controller cleared ACA163 for the ILS approach	he
the controller recognized ACA163 's reduced rate of descent	it was too late to correct the situation before losing separation
the high closing speeds	Directing altitude changes while vectoring two arriving aircraft onto reciprocal tracks increases a controller 's monitoring requirement , increases the risk of error from distraction , and makes recovery from any potential error more difficult
a turn	the aircraft to meet the speed restriction
the controller recognized ACA163 's	rate of descent
the use of a vectoring procedure that placed the two aircraft on reciprocal tracks at nearly identical altitudes	the controller 's time constraint
In part , the controller 's time constraint was caused by the use of a vectoring procedure	the two aircraft
this turn helped	the closure rate between the two aircraft
this turn	to reduce the closure rate between the two aircraft
This transmission	the first indication to ACA163 a traffic conflict was imminent
Directing altitude changes while vectoring two arriving aircraft onto reciprocal tracks increases a controller 's monitoring requirement	the risk of error from distraction
two arriving aircraft onto reciprocal tracks	a controller 's monitoring requirement
the risk of error from distraction	recovery from any potential error more difficult because of the high closing speeds
