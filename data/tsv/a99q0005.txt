The crew could therefore expect to be under the cloud layer before reaching the MAP	The likelihood of sighting the runway upon exiting the approach was
The likelihood of sighting the runway upon exiting the approach was therefore greater	, the decision to proceed to Saint-Augustin was reasonable
These oversights , and the fact that the first officer did not notice the missing items , reveal a lack of coordination within the crew and a lack of thoroughness , probably due to incomplete formal training and a lack of hands-on training and supervision	, the crew members did not have a common plan for pull-up , the most dangerous phase of an approach , when the obstacle clearance height was decreasing
examination of the aircraft did not reveal any deficiency	The possibility of a malfunction of one of the aircraft 's systems was ruled out
destination	the weather information supplied by the AAU indicated that the ceiling and visibility were below the approach minima
he did not specify the MDA or the MAP	The point where he wanted to abort the approach was not clearly established
incomplete formal training and a lack of hands-on training and supervision	These oversights , and the fact that the first officer did not notice the missing items , reveal a lack of coordination within the crew and a lack of thoroughness , probably
conditions did not permit descent below the MDA	The PMA method , however , would not have improved the safety of the flight
the aircraft was being operated under the safety requirements for approach obstacle clearance	The PMA method would thereby offer no safety advantages
diversion	the desire to improve the efficiency of the service provided to a community that practically depends on air transport to travel ; competition among the region 's operators ; concern about financial loss
the aircraft reached 100 feet agl , which is the minimum descent height that the crew had set for themselves	the captain , who was flying on instruments , had planned to abort the descent and maintain this height until he could see the runway
The MINIMUMS alarm sounded at a height that did not leave the captain time to abort the descent	avoid striking the ground
the captain disregarded the alarm , thinking that the aircraft was 100 feet above the river ,	he probably did not have time to initiate pull-up
using a dangerous method	that is , descending below the MDA without establishing visual contact with the required references and using the GPWS to approach the ground
controlling the operation of its aircraft and must ensure that pilots comply with existing regulations	The company 's management is responsible
he did not work at the same base as they	It is also conceivable that it was difficult for him to supervise the chief pilots
the whiteout	The first officer probably had difficulty perceiving depth
he was trying to establish visual contact with the runway	The captain did not effectively monitor the flight parameters
using a dangerous method	that is , descending below the MDA without establishing visual contact with the required references and using the GPWS to approach the ground
the aircraft 's rate of descent and other flight parameters	The GPWS MINIMUMS alarm sounded at a height that did not leave the captain time to initiate pull-up and avoid striking the ground
the time of the approach	the ceiling and visibility unofficially reported by the AAU were below the minima published on the approach chart
runway 02/20 was not under an approach ban	The decision to make the approach was consistent with existing regulations
conditions made it impossible to establish visual contact with the required references	Some R gionnair pilots descend below the MDA and use the GPWS to approach the ground
The captain	a routine briefing for the approach
he	the approach briefing
These oversights , and the fact that the first officer did not notice the missing items	a lack of coordination within the crew and a lack of thoroughness
The fact that the aircraft of a competing company was coming behind his	his decision
a visual flight path	the necessary corrections before landing on a snow-covered runway
winds	control of the aircraft
Three factors	the aircraft 's continued descent below that limit
The operation manager 's multiple operational , administrative , and financial functions within the company	the exercise of his air operations control and supervision responsibilities
the occurrence	the accident
In all likelihood , the irregularities	the safety of the flight
decision	the approach
the ground if conditions	it impossible to establish visual contact with the required references
