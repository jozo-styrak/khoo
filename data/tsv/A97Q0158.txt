They provided radar vectoring to help the pilot avoid adverse weather and transmitted relevant meteorological information , except SIGMETs C3 and C4	, the influence that these two SIGMETs might have had on the pilot 's decision to continue the flight could not be evaluated
A specific display of the meteorological conditions was not available to the controller	The controller was unaware of the areas of heavy precipitation because he did not have the equipment needed to display data from the Villeroy weather radar
The controller was therefore unaware of the areas of heavy precipitation because he did not have the equipment needed to display data from the Villeroy weather radar	, the controller did not have the information or tools required to accurately inform the pilot of safer alternate routes
he had enough reserve fuel	to wait or divert to another airport
that these two SIGMETs might have	the pilot 's decision to continue the flight could not be evaluated
before arriving at Cornwall he had received SIGMET C2 , which was essentially similar to C3 and C4	However , the pilot was aware of the dangers associated with the cold front
he did not have the equipment needed to display data from the Villeroy weather radar	The controller was therefore unaware of the areas of heavy precipitation
the controller occasionally had asked him to describe the weather he observed in front of him	Still , the pilot must have been at least somewhat aware of the limitations of the radar system
In any case , the pilot was entirely	the aircraft
evading	the storms
penetrating an area of severe turbulence and heavy precipitation	The aircraft broke up in flight
Examination of the debris	no signs of fatigue or flutter
the turbulence normally associated with that weather phenomenon	aerodynamic overloading of the wings
They	radar vectoring to help the pilot avoid adverse weather
radar vectoring	the pilot avoid adverse weather
several factors	his decision
His and his family 's apparent desire to land at Charlottetown before dusk on the first day of their one-week house rental	him to take risks
the controller on the position and movement of the areas of heavy precipitation	the information
He	that decision
the radar controller	the information
no indication that incapacitation or physiological factors	the pilots 's performance
