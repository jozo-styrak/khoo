The main power switch does not remove battery power from the processor board and the 12-volt input trace is not protected	, the over-current condition could not be interrupted , likely extending the duration of the fire
it had contacted live electrical components	However , the fan assembly did not exhibit signs of pitting or arcing , as it have
main power was removed from the SMU	the processor board continued to receive electrical energy from the backup batteries , likely contributing to the duration of the fire
one of the following	condition on the SMU processor board 12-volt trace
the dislodged CPU fan	A mechanical short
the SMU power supply	an over-voltage condition sufficient to cause electrical heating on the 12-volt copper trace
the SMU power supply produced an over-voltage condition	electrical heating on the 12-volt copper trace
an internal failure of the U18 component on the processor board	an excessive draw of current over the 12-volt trace , which produced excessive heat and caused the processor board to burn
This investigation concluded that an internal failure of the U18 component on the processor board resulted in an excessive draw of current over the 12-volt trace	excessive heat and
excessive heat	the processor board
When main power was removed from the SMU , the processor board continued to receive electrical energy from the backup batteries	the duration of the fire
Internal failure of the U18 switching regulator caused a high current draw and excessive heat on the 12-volt input trace	the processor board
Internal failure of the U18 switching regulator	a high current draw and excessive heat on the 12-volt input trace
The absence of a burn-in process	the likelihood of electrical component failure on in-service equipment
all electrical power from the entertainment system	the duration and intensity of a fire
