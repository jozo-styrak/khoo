nine months with partial fuel in the fuel tanks , or during previous fuelling of the aircraft	The water contamination could have been introduced into the system from rain leaking through the defective seal on the ferry tank plexiglass window before or during the previous ferry flight attempt , from water condensing in the fuel tanks while the aircraft was on the ground
The water in the system probably led to internal corrosion	the fuel
The water in the system	internal corrosion , which resulted in the fuel screens becoming severely contaminated with solid particles
The combination of solid particle contaminants and ice forming after exposure to the cold temperatures at altitude	a partial blockage
The combination of solid particle contaminants and ice forming after exposure to the cold temperatures at altitude probably resulted in a partial blockage	the initial drop in fuel flow
the auxiliary fuel pump	the fuel pressure
fuel	failure
fuel	problem
The conclusion that the initial fuel transfer problem was attributable to incorrect operation of the transfer system was	any firm data
An adequate examination of the fuel system after the initial ferry flight attempt	discrepancies -LRB- such as an improperly operating fuel system or fuel contamination -RRB- would have been corrected before the second ferry flight attempt
Water contamination in the fuel system	internal corrosion and solid particle contamination of the fuel screens
The contamination and water/ice	a complete blockage of fuel flow to the engine
fuel	problem on the initial ferry flight attempt as being caused by improper operation of the fuel system
An adequate examination of the fuel system after the initial ferry flight attempt	discrepancies -LRB- such as an improperly operating fuel system or fuel contamination -RRB- would have been corrected before the second ferry flight attempt
