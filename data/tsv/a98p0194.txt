the weather and operational conditions deteriorated below these minimum levels	the pilots decided to land and wait for the conditions to improve
closing in on the leading aircraft	the accident pilot reduced any advantage he may have had of receiving en route weather reports from the leading aircraft
following too closely	the pilot of the accident aircraft reduced his own ability to operate as an independent aircraft and placed the passengers of both aircraft at increased risk
the aircraft stalled	it yawed violently and entered a steep , nose-low attitude
As visibility decreased , the pilot of the accident aircraft closed in on the leading aircraft to maintain visual contact	, when the aircraft took off , the spacing between the two aircraft had been reduced to the point where the actions of the leading aircraft adversely affected the actions of the trailing aircraft
CARs	pilots conduct VFR flight in uncontrolled airspace and in weather conditions as low as 300 feet agl -LRB- the obstacle clearance limit -RRB- and 2 sm visibility
CARs	VFR flights be conducted in IFR weather conditions provided the aircraft is in uncontrolled airspace
in IFR weather conditions	the aircraft is in uncontrolled airspace
the accident pilot	any advantage he may have had of receiving en route weather reports
the pilot of the accident aircraft	his own ability to operate as an independent aircraft
the pilot of the accident aircraft reduced his own ability to operate as an independent aircraft	the passengers of both aircraft at increased risk
directive	specific procedures its pilots to follow when two or more aircraft are flying together on the same route
the airspeed was	to decrease to the point where the accident aircraft departed from controlled flight
Dual controls	the training and testing of new pilots throughout the entire range of the flight envelope
TC changed the pilot training programs	pilots with increased exposure
the actions of the leading aircraft	the actions of the trailing aircraft
