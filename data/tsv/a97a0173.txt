the pilot turned final for runway 24 during his first approach	he could not see any sign of the airport or its lighting , believing that he was flying above a cloud layer which was obscuring his view of the airport
Flight Into Terrain -LRB- CFIT -RRB- accidents	Controlled
Given the low altitude and airspeed , the pilot had to take immediate action	reduce the drag caused by the windmilling propeller
the low altitude and airspeed	the pilot had to take immediate action in order to reduce the drag caused by the windmilling propeller
analysing problems and taking corrective actions before the aircraft reaches a state where it can no longer be flown safely	An approach airspeed of 100 KIAS or more is recommended in the POH to provide more time , in the case of an emergency ,
the low airspeed at which the approach was attempted , the pilot 's actions in raising and lowering the nose of the aircraft , and the pilot not applying five degrees of bank into the good engine	The manufacturer 's calculations indicate that the aircraft should have been able to climb ; the fact that it did not climb may have been
fuel exhaustion	However , the engine failure described by the pilot is consistent with an engine stopping
the low airspeed and height at which the pilot was flying the approach	he had no time to analyse the engine malfunction before feathering the engine
The analysis will focus on human performance elements	the accident and on the single-engine performance demonstrated by the aircraft
The weather conditions were marginally acceptable for VFR flight in uncontrolled airspace , and the pilot 's decision to undertake the flight	the weather and
When the pilot turned final for runway 24 during his first approach , he could not see any sign of the airport or its lighting , believing that he was flying above a cloud layer	his view of the airport
This	little or no safety margin in the event of an aircraft malfunction
