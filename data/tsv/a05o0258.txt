The analysis will focus on the factors directly related to the occurrence : the fatigue failure of the crankshaft , and the ensuing stall and spin that followed the power loss	The crankshaft failed of a fatigue crack that developed on the forward fillet radius of the number six connecting rod journal
There was no indication of sudden stoppage in the engine-to-propeller reduction gearbox	, the prior propeller strike was not a factor in the failure of the crankshaft
a fatigue crack that developed on the forward fillet radius of the number six connecting rod journal	The crankshaft failed
a	manufacturing error
The pilot was current , and had adequate experience	, it could be expected that he would have had no problem flying the aircraft during normal operations
he was sufficiently distracted with the engine failure to lose control of the aircraft	It not be ascertained whether the pilot made an attempt to return to the airport for landing , or
Regardless , he did not follow the emergency procedures for engine failure after take-off	, the airspeed decreased below a safe flying speed
corrosion pitting and the absence of a case-hardened layer on the fillet radius of the number six connecting rod journal	A fatigue crack developed in the engine crankshaft
Control of the aircraft was not maintained during the power loss event	the airspeed decreased below a safe flying speed
the faulty fuel selector valve did	the engine failure
The absence of a case-hardened layer on the fillet radius in the region of the fatigue crack initiation	the failure
Fatigue failure of the engine crankshaft	a complete loss of power
A paramount distraction , such as an engine failure	the pilot to focus on the immediate emergency instead of on flying the aircraft
critical flight skills and procedures were practised	proficiency
The current recency requirements in Canada	pilots go for extended periods without any retraining in critical flight skills , creating the risk that pilots will not be prepared to deal with unusual or critical flight situations when they arise
The current recency requirements in Canada allow pilots to go for extended periods without any retraining in critical flight skills	the risk pilots will not be prepared to deal with unusual or critical flight situations when they arise
the pilot	an attempt to return to the airport for landing
The fatigue failure of this section of the engine crankshaft	a complete loss of power
Transport Canada recency requirements	pilots fly for extended periods of time without retraining in critical flight skills
The gradual erosion of these skills	a pilot 's preparedness
The fuel selector valve	internal leakage during testing
