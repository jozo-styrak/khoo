rubbing inside the sun gear eventually fell out	allowing the main rotor shaft to move vertically
installing the snap ring	MM 63.10.16.403 was used as the primary reference
most of the steps were not applicable to the task being performed	MRM WC 62.30.16.701 was not considered to be applicable information
None of the headings were considered pertinent	further reading of the material was deemed unnecessary
the snap ring could only be fitted in one specific groove on the main rotor shaft	They considered this redundant
verifying	an equal number of threads on the mast retaining bolts provided false confidence by implying that the assembly was done properly
a previous relationship between these symptoms was not known	The troubleshooting references , including technical representative consultations , did not link these symptoms to the snap ring installation sequence likely
in turn	the locking tabs holding the mast retaining bolts
The wrong installation sequence of the snap ring , relative to the spacer assembly	the snap ring
The bolts loosened by rubbing inside the sun gear , and eventually fell out	the main rotor shaft move vertically
The vertical movement of the main rotor shaft	the rotor blades
This	the AMEs to miss pertinent information concerning the proper installation sequence of the snap ring
The MM instructions	the AMEs to WC 62.30.16.701 check for correct fitting of the snap ring
the borescope to confirm a correct and complete installation by verifying an equal number of threads on the mast retaining bolts	false confidence by implying that the assembly was done properly
This	the snap ring being installed in the wrong sequence
The wrong installation sequence of the snap ring ultimately allowed the mast retaining bolts to loosen and the mast to move vertically	the rotor blades
The wrong installation sequence of the snap ring	the mast retaining bolts to loosen and the mast to move vertically
Referring AMEs to lengthy instructions , not necessarily required in full	a filtering process that causes important information to be missed
not necessarily required in full , may result in a filtering process	important information to be missed
