Examination of the aircraft wreckage determined that , other than the eye bolt fatigue cracking , there were no pre-impact anomalies	, airframe failure did not contribute to the water impact
Static testing revealed that , even with the eye bolt nut missing , the eye bolt likely would have stayed in position and the floats likely would not have moved any significant amount from their normal position	, even if the eye bolt had failed before impact , such a failure should not have resulted in the aircraft pitching nose-down and striking the water
Damage to the engine mounts was consistent with the attitude of the aircraft at impact with the water	, a pre-impact failure of the engine or propeller was considered to be unlikely
It is unlikely that such an acceleration could be achieved without an extreme increase in control column back pressure	, even if the pilot had increased the control column back pressure , the airspeed was greater than the stall speed and the aircraft would not have stalled
Investigators were not able to definitively determine the reason the aircraft struck the water	, several hypotheses were examined to determine which was most likely
the pilot had increased the control column back pressure	the airspeed was greater than the stall speed and the aircraft not have stalled
the pilot glanced to the left	it is possible that he unintentionally relaxed the back pressure on the control column , resulting in the aircraft pitching nose down and striking the water
the seat was not equipped with a shoulder harness	The risk of injury was increased
the seat was not equipped with a shoulder harness	The risk of injury was increased
airframe failure did	the water impact
such a failure	the aircraft pitching nose-down and striking the water
the pilot had	the control column
This	a need
When the pilot glanced to the left , it is possible that he unintentionally relaxed the back pressure on the control column	the aircraft pitching nose down
This off-duty period was only eight hours and	his additional need for transportation to and from a rest facility , meals and personal hygiene
the shorter-than-required sleep opportunity	the accident
by the injuries	his seatbelt
The horizontal stabilizer trim was set to a nose-down setting	a need for the pilot
The pilot most likely unintentionally relaxed the control column back pressure after take-off	the aircraft to pitch nose down and strike the water
Injuries sustained by the rear seat passenger	his escape the sinking aircraft
