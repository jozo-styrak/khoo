flying the helicopter sideways to his left restricted his view of the approaching guy wires	significantly increasing the possibility of contact between the main rotors and the wires
a component of the impact force is in the same direction as the orientation of the switch	This type of switch will automatically activate the ELT
During examination of the switch , black powder residue was found and the switch was seized within its casing	electrical contact was never established and the ELT failed to activate
the availability of phone service at the communications tower	The failure of the ELT did not affect the rescue of the three injured persons
being flown in a left sideward direction , which prevented the pilot from viewing the approaching tower guy wires from his position in the right front seat while focused on the somewhat restricted landing area	The helicopter struck the guy wires supporting the communications tower
a faulty internal G-switch	The ELT failed to activate on impact
The pilot 's decision to approach the landing site by flying the helicopter sideways to his left restricted his view of the approaching guy wires	the possibility of contact between the main rotors and the wires
the wire entanglement	the forces during ground impact and
the wire entanglement reduced the forces during ground impact	further structural damage and injuries the occupants
The helicopter struck the guy wires supporting the communications tower as a result of being flown in a left sideward direction	the pilot viewing the approaching tower guy wires from his position in the right front seat while focused on the somewhat restricted landing area
The internal parts of the switch are susceptible to deterioration over time	switch operation and ELT activation
