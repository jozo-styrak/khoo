night	particularly with overcast ceiling conditions
the illusion went unrecognized	the pilot have responded inappropriately by pushing the control column forward , causing the aircraft to descend after take-off and contact the ice surface

the extent of the damage	the possibility can not be ruled out that some unidentified fault or unexpected situation diverted the pilot 's attention from the task at hand
the severe aircraft destruction	The accident was non-survivable
An examination of the wreckage after the occurrence could find no evidence of a powerplant , flight control , or aircraft system failure	the occurrence
However	the extent of the damage
Toxicological and pathological examinations completed following the accident provided normal results	no indication of pilot incapacitation prior to impact
Toxicological and pathological examinations completed following the accident	normal results
inadequate ground and sky illumination	a lack of external visual references
At night , particularly with overcast ceiling conditions , a lack of external visual references caused by inadequate ground and sky illumination , coupled with the requirement to use cockpit lighting to illuminate the instrument panel	the pilot 's ability to maintain required visual reference with the ground during the initial climb
Any distraction during flight under these conditions would have further compounded the pilot 's workload	the maintenance of situational awareness very difficult
The forward acceleration of the Cessna 210 aircraft	a powerful illusion of increasing pitch attitude
a somatogravic illusion	the pilot to erroneously perceive an increase in the aircraft pitch attitude
If the illusion went unrecognized , the pilot may have responded inappropriately by pushing the control column forward	the aircraft to descend after take-off and contact the ice surface
Poor ground and sky illumination	the pilot maintaining adequate visual reference with the ground and likely required the pilot to rely on instrument flying skills , especially during the initial climb portion of the flight
Examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of a powerplant , flight control , or aircraft system failure	the occurrence
Examination of the wreckage	no evidence of a powerplant , flight control , or aircraft system failure
Toxicological and pathological examinations completed following the accident provided normal results	no indication of pilot incapacitation prior to impact
Toxicological and pathological examinations completed following the accident	normal results
Somatogravic illusion	the pilot 's performance during the acceleration stages of the take-off and initial climb
