the circuit breaker for the electric motor that operated the hydraulic pump had opened	The aircraft landing gear did not extend when the flight crew selected it down for landing at Ottawa
the depleted nitrogen charge in the hydraulic system accumulator likely caused the 60-amp circuit breaker to overheat and open , shutting off electric power to the hydraulic pump motor	The combination of repeated landing gear cycling at North Bay and more frequent cycling of the electric hydraulic pump motor
