Helicopters engaged in external load operations are not limited by the diagram	, pilots operating the Bell 205 helicopters in external load operations are exposed to a heightened level of risk because the potential to recover from a malfunction , such as power and drive train failure , is significantly reduced
which was a decoupled engine	was no longer driving the rotors
the engine was no longer driving the main rotor	the rotor rpm began to decay with a corresponding low rotor rpm warning and subsequent loss of lift
the decoupling occurred at an altitude of 150 feet and at an airspeed of less than 40 knots	the helicopter was operating in a flight regime from which the likelihood of establishing a successful autorotation was low
the potential to recover from a malfunction , such as power and drive train failure , is significantly reduced	Consequently , pilots operating the Bell 205 helicopters in external load operations are exposed to a heightened level of risk
a progressive failure or damage that was not detected at the time of the grease seal replacement	The main input drive shaft of the helicopter failed at the forward coupling , most likely
Failure of the main input drive shaft decoupled the engine from the transmission	a decrease in main rotor rpm
