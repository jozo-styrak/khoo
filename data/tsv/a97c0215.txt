The aircraft 's autopilot was unserviceable and the altimeter required calibration	, the aircraft was not approved for flight under IFR , and , in the prevailing weather , was , therefore , not approved for flight into cloud
the aircraft was not equipped for flight into icing conditions and the area forecast included icing in cloud	the aircraft was not approved for flight into cloud during the accident flight
the time of departure	the cloud ceiling met the requirements for night VFR flight in the Fort McMurray area
the low altitude which the pilot flew to maintain clearance from cloud	the lights of La Loche
prevailing on departure	reference available en route and at the time of the accident decreased markedly from
Flight below the cloud left the pilot with reduced terrain clearance	the requirement for effective manoeuvring
The lighting conditions on departure	the pilot to maintain a visual reference to the ground
the lights of La Loche	him little assistance
weather and lighting conditions	VFR flight impracticable
one or more of these factors	the pilot 's decision to depart
the CARs for the accident flight	minimum en route altitude
