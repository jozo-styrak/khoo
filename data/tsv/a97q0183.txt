The more the pilot pulled back the controls , the greater the drag	the aircraft could not attain a climb rate sufficient to clear the obstacles on its flight path , and it struck the high-voltage lines and a pole
the very tight schedules he had set for himself	He was highly stressed
any time during this second attempt	the pilot could have aborted the take-off run and revised his load
its nose-up attitude , caused by the fact that the centre of gravity was outside the envelope and displaced aft , and because of the excess weight	The aircraft took an abnormally long distance before rising out of the water
the ground effects phenomenon	After 8,000 feet of take-off run , which is over twice the distance normally required , the aircraft lifted off , partly
its configuration	the aircraft stall speed was higher than normal
he did not take enough rest in preparation for the flight	The pilot was fatigued ,
He had not allowed enough time to prepare his camps for the hunting season	himself under pressure
Knowing that his clients were already flying to the camps , and that the cooks had not yet arrived	him be determined to take off on his second attempt
the fact	an abnormally long distance before rising out of the water because of its nose-up attitude
This nose-up attitude of the floats in the water caused drag	the aircraft accelerating during the take-off run within the normal distance
This nose-up attitude of the floats in the water	drag that prevented the aircraft from accelerating during the take-off run within the normal distance
a climb rate	the obstacles on its flight path
a rate of climb	the obstacles on its flight path
