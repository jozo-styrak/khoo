Under Canadian Aviation Regulations , service letters and bulletins themselves are not mandatory unless mandated by the foreign civil aviation authority or referenced by an airworthiness directive -LRB- AD -RRB-	, MDHI rotor blades are subjected to a fatigue factor that may not be accurately tracked by operators
the manufacturer relies on the inspections to reveal cracks and retire the component	The blades essentially reach on-condition status
identifying lightening hole cracks , or any documented standards to accept material flaws in this part of the main rotor blades , so the crack in the C channel rendered the rotor blade not airworthy .5 The blades may not reach their expected life of 3530 hours TIS	There are no prescribed inspections
the helicopter does not automatically register and record the number of times that it transitions from a hover to forward flight , and/or the number of lifts	In operations where the helicopter is subjected to a high number of torque events , accounting of torque events may be more difficult and imprecise
a finger swipe along the length of this channel may not reveal slight imperfections which are best detected with magnification	The manufacturer 's method of inspection for the C channel consists of running a finger over the lightening holes to check for surface flaws or imperfections , such as burrs or nicks ; this may be inadequate
integrity of the main rotor blade and its fatigue life	the structural
the four unsecured blades flutter in the wind and exert leveraged bending forces as they rise and fall	Tying down only one blade may exacerbate the bending forces ,
metal fatigue , which originated from relatively large pits or imperfections on the C channel lightening hole surface	The main rotor blade cracked
a crack propagation may develop rapidly and/or be difficult to detect with the prescribed visual inspection	Maintenance interventions to correct for the out-of-track condition were not successful
accounting of torque events relies on the pilot 's recollection of the operations	Main rotor blades are subjected to a fatigue factor that may not be accurately tracked by operators
these imperfections are best detected with magnification	The quality assurance finger swipe inspection method for surface flaws or imperfections at the lightening holes of the C channel is inadequate ,
the four unsecured blades flutter in the wind and exert leveraged bending forces as they rise and fall	Tying down only one blade may exacerbate the bending forces ,

MDHI developed the inspection interval	their evaluation of crack growth analysis
This inspection may not detect slight sub-surface anomalies or imperfections	the structural integrity of the main rotor blade and its fatigue life
