Because the helicopter was so heavy , it was unable to cleanly lift the load clear of the ground and into forward flight	, during the transition to forward flight , the helicopter descended and the load struck the tarmac and then the other sling load
the helicopter was so heavy	it was unable to cleanly lift the load clear of the ground and into forward flight
its heavy gross weight	the helicopter was unable to cleanly lift the load clear of the ground during transition into forward flight

The damage inside the Hell Hole to the cannon plug , tail rotor control tube , and throttle control tubes most likely occurred when the trailer tow bar dug into the ground , as this would have created a sudden deceleration of the trailer	high rearward forces on the cargo hook
this	a sudden deceleration of the trailer
Damage in this area	the pilot controlling the helicopter and releasing the load
It	operation of the throttles
The downward bending to the nose of the helicopter	discontinuities in the electrical systems
The pilot	this pylon rock
