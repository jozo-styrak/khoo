the practice of not reporting windrows on other than active runways	Neither lead-hand nor the ground controller were made aware of the creation of the windrow
the freezing drizzle , the stranded Airbus , and the frequent runway changes	The night shift had a significantly increased workload
snow plowing activities , and it is likely	whoever had knowledge of the windrow had departed the field prior to the taxi clearance being issued and would not have been available to warn of the existence of the windrow
the pressing need to prepare Runway 29 and move the stranded Airbus	The oncoming lead-hand did not perform the customary field survey and inspection
The taxi speed of the aircraft and the icy condition of the runway hindered the stopping of the aircraft	did not allow time for the captain to apply reverse thrust , or to consider initiating the Propeller Collisions during Ground Operation checklist
the taxi speed of the aircraft been less	more time would have been available for the crew to recognize and react to the windrow
it is possible that the crew could have stopped the aircraft prior to the collision , or that the Propeller Collisions during Ground Operation check could have been completed , lessening the risk of aircraft damage and physical harm to the passengers	react
Several factors combined	this large windrow remain unreported
A field inspection	detection of the windrow
The crew 's previous safe transit through the intersection and the lack of any warning of obstructions along their taxi route	them proceeding with their normal taxi routine , and without extra vigilance for taxi hazards such as windrows
The flat-light conditions and the white background of the uncleared portions of the airfield also caused the windrow to blend into the background	it less conspicuous from a distance
The flat-light conditions and the white background of the uncleared portions of the airfield	the windrow to blend into the background
These actions and the inconspicuousness of the windrow	the crew seeing the windrow earlier
The taxi speed of the aircraft and the icy condition of the runway	the stopping of the aircraft
The taxi speed of the aircraft did not allow the crew sufficient time to respond once they saw the windrow	the risk of collision , damage , and physical harm the passengers
The lighting conditions at the time	the windrow difficult to see
