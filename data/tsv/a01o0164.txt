the blind spot created by the lower right cabin wall/door of the helicopter	The helicopter pilot did not see the Cessna
the blind spot created above and to the left by the aircraft 's high wing	The Cessna pilot did not see the helicopter
it was hidden from the pilot 's view by the Cessna 's high wing	Similarly , the Cessna pilot could not see the helicopter ,
either pilot been aware of the proximity of the other aircraft through direct or indirect communication	the collision might have been averted
a number of factors combined	the collision to occur
the lower right cabin wall/door of the helicopter	the blind spot
he was	positive separation
This pitching movement	a bending moment of the remaining main-rotor blade
it has limitations	separation
the recommended VHF frequency	position reports
On-board equipment , such as a traffic alert and collision-avoidance system -LRB- TCAS -RRB- , designed to operate independently of the ATC system	pilots traffic information
A TCAS warning	either pilot adequate warning
The design limitations of both aircraft with respect to pilot visibility , combined with the intercept geometry	the pilots ' failure to see and avoid the other aircraft
Neither aircraft was equipped with a traffic alert and collision-avoidance system -LRB- TCAS -RRB-	the pilots a defence against collision
