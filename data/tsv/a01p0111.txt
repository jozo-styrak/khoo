The pilot of ACA1118 did not conform to the published vertical noise-abatement procedure -LRB- VNAP -RRB- A for Vancouver or the Air Canada VNAP profile	, his flight path was inconsistent with normal departure profiles , which were the basis for an air traffic control -LRB- ATC -RRB- clearance
Although he acknowledged the instructions , the pilot of ACA1118 was tardy in his response to the departure controller 's instruction to turn left to 360 at 3000 feet	, he introduced a significant displacement of the planned flight path to avoid the Cessna
The Air Canada fleet noise-abatement procedures are not consistent with the noise-abatement procedures that Canadian ATC controllers expect jet aircraft to follow	, ATC controllers are exposed to inconsistent aircraft climb performance , and there is an elevated risk of loss of separation
ATC controllers in Vancouver were generally unaware that Air Canada aircraft did not follow the published VNAP A profile	, the controllers were unable to make allowance for performance differences between departing aircraft
climb , and manoeuvre under various conditions	turn
Although the controller 's plan would likely have succeeded had the A320 reached 3000 feet at the NDB	begun to turn , it was fundamentally flawed in that the criterion he established for ACA1118 to begin the turn was based on the A320 reaching a specific altitude
instructing ACA1118 to reach 3000 feet and turn at or near the NDB	the lateral spacing he wanted could have been assured
potential aircraft performance	the controller could have reverted to an alternative plan , such as continuing the aircraft straight ahead on the runway heading
the A320 did not turn as expected	the controller attempted to salvage the quickly deteriorating situation with small heading changes
the A320 's wide radius of turn at 280 knots and 15 of bank in consideration of pilot and aircraft reaction times	the A320 's flight path would have been only slightly affected in the brief time before safety would not have been assured with the Cessna
he had heard more-imperative instructions	the pilot flying have responded more quickly and used a greater angle of bank in turning the aircraft
it created a diverging flight path situation , so no real risk of collision existed	That the Cessna was already established in a left orbit was fortuitous ,
a choice existed between VNAP A and B	controllers were informed of the profile about to be flown and took appropriate traffic management action
the controllers were not aware of the remarkable differences in the profiles or that the Air Canada profile existed	In the operating environment at the time of this incident , however , the potential for a loss of separation or a collision was further increased
the departure controller realized that ACA1118 was not adhering to his instructions	he issued incremental corrective heading changes
the A320 's high speed and large radius of turn	The changes could not have prevented the air proximity event
The chain of events	this incident included controller expectations
this delay	the required lateral space
the A320 was about 50 knots faster than normal significantly	this dynamic situation
Based on previous experience with other jet aircraft on departure from Runway 08R , the departure controller anticipated that ACA1118 would have reached at least 3000 feet at the NDB	the aircraft to begin a turn
in that the criterion he established for ACA1118 to begin the turn	the A320 reaching a specific altitude
the controller had	separation between the A320
it	more passing clearance between the two aircraft
it	a diverging flight path situation
The Air Canada VNAP profile did	this incident
it is an anomaly in the general noise-abatement procedures approval process	ATC separation
traffic management	performance conflicts between departing jet aircraft
the level of risk for a loss-of-separation event	the opportunity for an unsafe situation
This lack of cooperation	a situation
It	a situation of inconsistency and increased risk among air carriers operating from Vancouver International Airport
a situation of inconsistency	risk among air carriers operating from Vancouver International Airport
the controllers were	allowance for performance differences between departing aircraft
Although the departure controller recognized that the A320 was not responding to his initial instructions in a timely manner , he did not issue corrective instructions	the traffic conflict
The changes	the air proximity event because of the A320 's high speed and large radius of turn
their flight path	the risk of collision
