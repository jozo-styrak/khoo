Additionally , search helicopters were able to fly along the route to the fuel cache in visual flight conditions after the accident	, it is likely that the weather was substantially as forecast along the route flown and was not a factor in the accident
The engine 's number three bearing failed , resulting in a rearward movement of the power turbine shaft which cut the engine 's Py line	, the engine 's rotational speed decreased to about ground idle speed , which is insufficient to sustain flight
The burnishing and plastic deformation of the corrosion pit edges on the number two bearing indicate that the number two bearing was operated subsequent to the formation of the corrosion pits	, the corrosion pitting of the number two bearing occurred prior to the engine being submerged in the lake
Since the number two and number three bearings are located close to each other and share the same lubrication system , the number two and number three bearings would have been exposed to the same environmental conditions	, since the corrosion pitting of the number three bearing is similar , the corrosion pitting of the number three bearing also occurred prior to the engine being submerged in the lake
Consequently , since the corrosion pitting of the number three bearing is similar , the corrosion pitting of the number three bearing also occurred prior to the engine being submerged in the lake	, it is likely that corrosion pitting caused the failure of the number three bearing
not closing the fuel control lever because the helicopter landed in the lake so any post-impact fire would be quickly extinguished	If the pilot was rushed , this could indicate that the helicopter 's height above the lake was low at the time of the engine power loss , because time in autorotation reduces as height is reduced
accident	the
there was no message from the helicopter by the survey technician indicating any emergency condition	it is likely that the power loss occurred quickly and that there was little advance warning of the impending bearing failure
the corrosion pitting of the number three bearing is similar	the corrosion pitting of the number three bearing also occurred prior to the engine being submerged in the lake
both bearings were installed in the engine and as there are no records indicating that the engine had been preserved in accordance with the maintenance manual from 28 May 2004 to 06 June 2007	the corrosion likely occurred during this period
the rapid power loss occurred	the pilot was required to follow the emergency procedures as outlined in the basic flight manual and the supplement for the Honeywell engine
the helicopter landed in the lake so any post-impact fire would be quickly extinguished	In either case there was no adverse consequence to not closing the fuel control lever
time in autorotation reduces as height is reduced	If the pilot was rushed , this could indicate that the helicopter 's height above the lake was low at the time of the engine power loss ,
the pilot was distracted during a critical flight manoeuvre	The 950-foot distance from shore was equivalent to nine seconds of flight time in autorotation and the time easily have been lost
sufficient kinetic energy in the main rotor blades	the pilot would have been unable to control the water landing
the same aural warning occurs for hydraulic pressure , the pilot would have had to differentiate between the two possibilities	The pilot would have had an aural warning of the reduction in rotor rpm but
the en route altitude selected was too low to permit an autorotation to shore , because the pilot 's response to the engine power loss slowed the establishment of an effective autorotation toward the shore , or because he was attempting to land near the shoreline of the lake in response to the first indication of the impending bearing failure	The pilot conducted a forced landing into the lake
there is no information provided in the basic flight manual with respect to glide ratios	shore
The engine 's number three bearing failed	a rearward movement of the power turbine shaft which cut the engine 's Py line
corrosion pitting	the failure of the number three bearing
this may have distracted the pilot	recognition of the engine condition
this	the pilot
This distraction	the effectiveness of the turn towards the shore
either the flare or collective pitch increase or both at higher-than-recommended heights	the loss of the kinetic energy of the main rotor blades

the pilot	the water landing
This	the pilot 's response
the pilot 's response	the pilot to be rushed
A delay in responding to the audible warning	a large drop in rotor rpm , excessive altitude loss , or loss of control
The severity of the impact	the inability of the occupants to egress as the helicopter sank
The distance from shore	the occupants ' chances of survival had they exited the aircraft
engine power was	to about ground idle
the pilot 's response to the engine power loss	the establishment of an effective autorotation toward the shore
Premature initiation of the flare	the loss of the kinetic energy of the main rotor blades at a height from which the pilot would have been unable to control the water landing
the pilot	the water landing
Although regulations require pilots to fly the helicopter at a distance and height	an autorotation to shore
