A combination of the high rate of descent , low airspeed , large power application , and significant nose attitude change led to aircraft handling characteristics that the pilots had not previously experienced	, when the instrument scan of the pilot-flying broke down , he lost directional control and the helicopter turned right
the increase in collective pitch to begin the climb	Aggravating the pilot 's workload was the significant torque-related force turning the helicopter to the right
his unfamiliarity with the low speed ILS approach profile	It is most likely that the pilot began to lose situational awareness
the effect was masked by other attitude changes and the lack of external visual references	The turn itself was not detected by either of the pilots , most likely
A combination of the high rate of descent , low airspeed , large power application , and significant nose attitude change	aircraft handling characteristics that the pilots had not previously experienced
The pilot-flying lost situational awareness	the helicopter to turn 100 degrees away from the published missed approach procedure heading
