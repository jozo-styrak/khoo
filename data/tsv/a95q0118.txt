Even very light contact will result in rapid frictional heating , which allows the normal torsional loads on the coupling to impart a twisting deformation	in further interference and an imbalance condition
an accumulation of carbon and oil sludge on the outer surface of the coupling and/or on the inner surface of the shaft	The disassembly revealed that interference between the turbine-to-compressor coupling and the power inner shaft had occurred during operation , most probably
torsional stress	The turbine-to-compressor coupling shaft was heavily carboned , both internally and externally , and was deformed
Even very light contact	rapid frictional heating , which allows the normal torsional loads on the coupling to impart a twisting deformation
Even very light contact will result in rapid frictional heating	the normal torsional loads on the coupling to impart a twisting deformation
This	further interference and an imbalance condition
The contact between parts tends	the speed differential
