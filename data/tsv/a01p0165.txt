the hydraulic-pump circuit-breaker had previously tripped	the hydraulic pump did not operate
the landing gear was selected UP after take-off	both pilots were concentrating on visually monitoring the local traffic
the placards are next to the landing-gear handle rather than near the indicator lights	Although the flight manual supplement adequately describes the landing-gear system , the relationship between the lights and the handle position may not be clear to all pilots
such documentation	any other pilots who subsequently fly the aircraft would be unaware of the intermittent problem that had been identified with the landing-gear system and would therefore be placed at increased risk
the circuit breaker had tripped , the pump did not operate	However ,
Additionally , the landing-gear indicator lighting system was in the DIM position	the conspicuity of the indicator lights
A more detailed checklist on the operation of the landing-gear system , rather than an elemental system description	the risk of this accident occurring
requirement	such a checklist
The DIM switch setting	the pilots ' ability to distinguish which set of landing-gear lights was illuminated
A pressure switch in the landing-gear circuit failed on arrival at Chilliwack	the hydraulic pump
The aircraft landed on water with the landing gear extended	the aircraft to overturn
the landing-gear lights to DIM	the difficulty of distinguishing set of lights is illuminated when operating in daylight conditions
