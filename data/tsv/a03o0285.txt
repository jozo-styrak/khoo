The aircraft was flying in conditions where carburettor ice was a real possibility , and the engine symptoms were like those associated with carburettor icing	, it is concluded that the loss of power was related to carburettor ice
the likelihood of an engine power loss during flight	reduce
the lower volumetric efficiency of warmer air , which results in a richer mixture	When carburettor heat is selected on , engine power is reduced
carburettor heat is selected on	engine power is reduced because of the lower volumetric efficiency of warmer air , which results in a richer mixture
the ambient temperature and dew point values were in the range where moderate carburettor icing could occur	Weather was a factor in this occurrence ,
the engine began to lose power	the pilot applied carburettor heat , but noted it resulted in a further decrease in engine power and selected the carburetor heat off
When carburettor heat is selected on , engine power is reduced because of the lower volumetric efficiency of warmer air	a richer mixture
As the ice melts , it is ingested into the engine intake as water	engine roughness
engine roughness	power
the ice formation	the engine to regain power
Ambient temperature and dew point conditions during the flight most likely	carburettor icing , which caused the engine to lose power
Ambient temperature and dew point conditions during the flight most likely resulted in carburettor icing	the engine to lose power
it	a further decrease in engine power
The pilot was unable to find a suitable landing area and intentionally stalled the aircraft into the trees	substantial damage to the aircraft
The pilot was	a suitable landing area
