The primary roles of ATC are to prevent collision and to expedite traffic	, pilots expect that when they communicate with the London tower , they will receive instructions or clearances from the ATC to steer them clear of known traffic or , at a minimum , receive sufficient information to acquire the traffic visually so they can take appropriate action themselves
When a pilot transitions from one class of airspace to another , there may be changes to the level of service , such as a change from control service to advisory , or vice versa	, pilots may be under a misconception about how much information and/or control action is being provided by the ATC
The position of Unit Operations Specialist had not been staffed at the London ATC unit for a considerable time	, there was limited support for the London tower manager who is responsible for overseeing the operation , reviewing or revising existing procedures , and developing new procedures
a pilot transitions from one class of airspace to another	there may be changes to the level of service , such as a change from control service to advisory , or vice versa
the same time	ATC personnel may , in some cases , expect pilots to take action on their own based on received traffic information and not wait for specific ATC clearances or instructions
the pilot of WJA107 was not informed that the Cessna was flying an opposite-direction simulated-IFR approach to Runway 15	he would not have been aware that the traffic mentioned to him earlier posed a risk of collision
overseeing the operation , reviewing or revising existing procedures , and developing new procedures	Therefore , there was limited support for the London tower manager who is responsible
conducting this type of operation based on other than the official weather report	Although the conditions observed by the controller seemed adequate for the simulated IFR approach , there was no flexibility included in the published procedure
authorizing reciprocal approaches when there is an IFR departure planned , nor did the tower controller coordinate the simulated IFR opposite-end approach with the ACC controller	The tower controller did not follow published procedures
The primary roles of ATC are	collision
the ATC	and/or control action is being
action on their own	traffic
the tower controller	traffic information both the instrument flight rules -LRB- IFR -RRB- departure -LRB- WJA107 -RRB-
the required action	a conflict-free departure path out of the control zone , especially in light of the instrument meteorological conditions encountered in the climb-out
this type of operation	other than the official weather report
This	the time
The tower controller did not advise the ACC controller of a potential conflict on the departure path for Runway 33	the initiation of ACC control action
Procedures published in the London Control Tower Unit Operations Manual require controllers	conflict resolution
authority	a control service
