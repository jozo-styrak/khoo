the force of gravity and the nose-down -LRB- diving -RRB- turn before impact	the aircraft likely reached a higher airspeed at impact than when control was lost
an aerodynamic stall	Since the stall speed for this aircraft in the configuration at the time control was lost is about 60 mph , it is concluded that the loss of control was
the wind conditions	the aircraft 's airspeed may have been changing rapidly up and down
turning into the left bank and pushing the flight control forward may have allowed the aircraft to start flying again ; however	the aircraft 's height above the lake was too low to allow the aircraft to reach level flight before striking the surface
The increased g-loading in the turn , the reduction in power , the heavy weight of the aircraft , its aft C of G condition , and the retraction of the flaps	reduced climb performance
the pilot 's attempt to maintain a climb in the left turn out of wind	the aircraft 's airspeed to decrease
The aft C of G condition	the adverse characteristics of roll , yaw , and pitch that followed the stall
power reduction , the aircraft 's heavy weight , the aft C of G , retraction of the flaps , and the wind conditions	the aircraft stalling
the lake surface before the pilot	a level-flight attitude
The pilot	power and
The pilot reduced power and raised the flaps before the climb was complete , contrary to the Pilot Operating Handbook	the aircraft 's stall speed
The shoulder harnesses worn by the pilot and the front passenger	serious head injuries
