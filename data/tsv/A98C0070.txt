Functional testing and repair of the pump , conducted in 1992 , was limited in scope and did not require complete disassembly and re-build	, the progressive wear went undetected
However , it is possible that the time that he used to reassure the passengers and time that he may have spent analysing the power interruptions resulted in an altitude or airspeed loss that eliminated the possibility of a turn into wind	, when the engine failed completely , the pilot was faced with executing an autorotation with a strong tailwind , over a relatively featureless surface
The damage sustained by the main rotor and tail rotor components and their respective control systems resulted from the impact of the helicopter and its components with the ice	The engine-driven fuel pump failed of a progressive failure of the drive splines of the No. 1 element of the pump and subsequent metal contamination of the No. 1 element check valve
post-accident examination of the fuel filter showed no evidence of filter contamination or restriction , if the pressure differential switch had been installed and the system had been working , the fuel filter bypass warning would not have been activated	However ,
it was unlikely that the maximum range fuel flows could have been achieved during the operations flown that morning	more fuel would have been used , there would have been less fuel on board and the weight of the helicopter would likely have been somewhat less than 2 531.5 pounds
the engine failed completely	the pilot was faced with executing an autorotation with a strong tailwind , over a relatively featureless surface
the	helicopter and its components with the ice
a progressive failure of the drive splines of the No. 1 element of the pump and subsequent metal contamination of the No. 1 element check valve	The engine-driven fuel pump failed
The failure of the pump splines resulted from the combined effects of continued operation of chromed drive shaft splines against non-chromed spur gear splines	of the breakdown of a nitride ` white layer '
The absence of the pressure differential switch and warning system	the occurrence
the time that he used to reassure the passengers and time that he may have spent analysing the power interruptions	an altitude or airspeed loss that eliminated the possibility of a turn into wind
the pilot was	the helicopter
the non-functioning filter bypass warning system	the occurrence
The progressive failure of the pump	short-duration power deviations that became more exaggerated until the engine suffered a complete loss of power
