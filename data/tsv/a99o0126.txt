The pilot may have also been subjected to somatogravic illusion	was that the pilot allowed the aircraft to commence a shallow descent until it struck trees , which compromised the integrity of the aircraft
busy highway traffic during the holiday weekend	The pilot and passenger arrived late at the airport
the severity of the impact sequence	many of the avionics components and instruments did not reveal conclusive information
the impact damage sustained by its various components	The ELT did not function
The pilot	the U.S. training provider licensing documentation that indicated that he held an instrument rating when , in fact , he did not hold this rating
TC CAM could not declare with any certainty that the combination of medical conditions experienced by this pilot would or would not have met all the criteria	a valid medical certificate be issued , since the required medical investigations were either not available or had not been done for some of the conditions of interest
the pilot most likely	a left turn shortly after take-off
This diversion during the transition from visual flight to instrument flight	the pilot to become disoriented and to misinterpret or improperly scan the flight instruments
The overall result was that the pilot allowed the aircraft to commence a shallow descent until it struck trees	the integrity of the aircraft
the pilot	the aircraft to commence a shallow descent until it struck trees , which compromised the integrity of the aircraft
to somatogravic illusion	the aircraft to descend into terrain after a night take-off in IMC
The aircraft engine teardown examination	no pre-impact failures of any component parts or accessories in either the left or right engine that would have precluded normal engine operation
