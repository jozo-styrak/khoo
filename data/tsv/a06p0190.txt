The dimensional restoration repair of the spindle journal introduced a stress concentration feature at the location of the subsurface radius , which was	the formation of the fatigue crack and subsequent failure of the right-hand pylon support spindle
the helicopter had flown for any longer	any uncontrolled gyrations that have occurred would likely have resulted in the helicopter breaking apart in flight
the accident site was compact	it is more likely that the helicopter was at a low altitude and collided with the ground before time allowed it to break up in flight
The dimensional restoration repair of the spindle journal introduced a stress concentration feature at the location of the subsurface radius , which was	the formation of the fatigue crack and subsequent failure of the right-hand pylon support spindle
Examination of the ground scars and photographs taken before the wreckage was moved	a wreckage distribution pattern associated with a condition of high deceleration forces and a steep angle of descent to the level ground , which is consistent with a loss of control
any uncontrolled gyrations that may have occurred	the helicopter breaking apart in flight
with the ground before time	it break up in flight
Failure of the right-hand pylon support spindle in flight	the helicopter to become uncontrollable and collide with the level ground
Transport Canada	inquiries regarding approved spindle repair procedures following the release of Bell Helicopter Textron Inc
Operational Safety Notice 206-99-35 Revision A , but closed the file without formally reviewing or cancelling the two approved repair certificates	the repair to continue in its original form
