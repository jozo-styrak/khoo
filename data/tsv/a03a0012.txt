the first officer did not respond immediately to his verbal direction	The captain took control , not because of reduced visibility , but
a layer of ground fog , preventing them from detecting and correcting the aircraft 's left drift prior to touchdown	The crew 's visual cues were degraded in the final moments of the approach
the crew were	relatively minor corrections
The crew 's difficulty seeing the runway centerline markings in the final moments , after the aircraft was in the low-energy regime , combined with sudden heavy wind gusts	the crew detecting and correcting the aircraft 's drift
the wet runway	the aircraft drifting to the downwind side of the runway
The continued application of right wheel braking	the recovery of directional control
The standing water on Runway 24	flight crews using the best-equipped and most-desirable runway for arrivals and departures
The installation of an incorrect FDR	the TSB completely assessing the aircraft 's flight parameters during the incident
The crew 's visual cues were degraded in the final moments of the approach because of a layer of ground fog	them detecting and correcting the aircraft 's left drift prior to touchdown
a combination of drift , reverse thrust , strong gusting crosswind , and the wet runway	the loss of aircraft directional control
the continued application of right wheel braking throughout the loss of control	recovery of directional control
The standing water on Runway 24	crews using the best-equipped and most desirable runway for landing
