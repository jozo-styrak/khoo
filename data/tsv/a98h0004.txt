an unanticipated and unplanned defence , in that the operator of Staff 61 received information about a landing aircraft from the sound of the approaching jet engines	It did not become an accident
the fog was not perceived to be an obstruction to vision sufficient to hide the vehicle from view	Although it was the specialist 's habit to scan the entire length of the runway prior to an aircraft landing , as he did in this instance after NAVCAN 200 advised joining downwind , it was ineffective
scanning the entire work area , learned during qualification training , were not effective , and , as a result , he did not recall the presence of the vehicle on the runway	The specialist 's techniques
conducting efficient and effective visual scans of the manoeuvring surfaces , no guidance or techniques are provided for the overall scanning of the specialist 's entire work area in order to integrate information into a complete mental picture	Although the FSS MANOPS provides guidance
Although the FSS MANOPS provides guidance for conducting efficient and effective visual scans of the manoeuvring surfaces , no guidance or techniques are provided for the overall scanning of the specialist 's entire work area	integrate information into a complete mental picture : situational awareness
gathering information to ensure that the pertinent facts are recalled into working memory at the correct time	A more positive intervention is required to change a specialist 's established routine
providing	more than one person/agency access to the information necessary for safe operations is lost when the information is restricted to only the FSS
the right set of circumstances	any statistically rare event such as a runway incursion will eventually occur
the workload during the four hours prior to the occurrence	neither FSS specialist on duty was afforded the opportunity for a relief break
the likelihood of a single failure	an accident
in the concept of defences in depth , or redundancy , and the timely and accurate dissemination of information	the likelihood of a single failure leading to an accident
potential	an accident
a single lapse	this occurrence
This action most likely	an accident
that individual	safe and effective decisions
the FSS MANOPS	guidance conducting efficient and effective visual scans of the manoeuvring surfaces
no guidance or techniques are	the overall scanning of the specialist 's entire work area
A lack of effective integration of internal and external cues by the individual providing air traffic services	an incomplete mental picture being used to make decisions
internal and external cues by the individual	air traffic services
an incomplete mental picture being used	decisions
only the visual scan to provide situational awareness while inadvertently disregarding other displayed information	the risk critical information will be missed
only the visual scan	situational awareness
the data strips	defence
as a sufficient stimulus	an individual to recall specific information from memory
snow-clearing operations	the coordination and communications workload for the FSS and vehicle operators
This procedure	unrestricted travel within the work area
The absence of radio communications to and from the vehicle	the specialist recalling the presence of the vehicle at a critical time
This type of active warning	the positive intervention required to ensure the specialists do not overlook other sources of critical information
the positive intervention required	the specialists do not overlook other sources of critical information
The capability to listen to the other active frequency by the aircrew or the vehicle operator	the likelihood of this occurrence happening
the addition of another observer -LRB- or set of observers -RRB- to the conflict avoidance team	the resources for error detection
the addition of another observer -LRB- or set of observers -RRB- to the conflict avoidance team certainly increases the resources for error detection	the chance of this type of occurrence from happening again
