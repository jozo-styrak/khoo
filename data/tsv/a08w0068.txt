speed indicates that the pilot was maintaining a high cruise speed for several minutes as he attempted to maintain control before entering the spiral , thus reducing the margin before the speeds and aerodynamic loads exceeded structural limits	Any nose-down divergence from level flight would continue to increase the angle of dive or spiral , leading to a very high airspeed excursion within a very short period of time
an over-reading gauge	The vacuum system appeared to have been operating normally , although possibly at a lower setting than specified by the manufacturer
the problems with the KI256 gyro/horizon noted on previous flights , such as the unstable autopilot outputs from the gyro/horizon and noisy bearings	the instrument shop recommended that it be replaced or overhauled
the aircraft would not easily maintain its trimmed airspeed	This decrease in stability would have resulted in an increase in pilot workload
The pilot normally would not hand-fly the aircraft other than for take-off and landing	would not likely be prepared to deal with an unserviceable autopilot as well as a primary attitude indicator failure in instrument meteorological conditions
TC was previously	inspections and audits of POC holders until the POC program was transferred to the CBAA
the auditing interval being set at the maximum allowed of three years	Subsequent monitoring of the developing SMS program of this new POC operator was ineffective
effective oversight of POC holders is not exercised by the regulator or its delegated organization	there is an increased risk that safety deficiencies not be identified and properly addressed
a vacuum system that was possibly not at minimum operating requirements for the instrument	The gyro/horizon failed due to excessive wear on bearings and other components , resulting from a lack of maintenance and
excessive wear on bearings and other components , resulting from a lack of maintenance and due to a vacuum system that was possibly not at minimum operating requirements for the instrument	The gyro/horizon failed
an increase of the aircraft 's pitch control sensitivity	These two factors made the aircraft more difficult to handle
effective oversight of private operator certificate -LRB- POC -RRB- holders is not exercised by the regulator or its delegated organization	there is an increased risk that safety deficiencies not be identified and properly addressed
The lack of maintenance on the KI256 gyro/horizon	considerable internal component drag from the deteriorated bearings
This drag , possibly in combination with the system vacuum that was not operating at the minimum required	the attitude gyro
the subsequent toppling of the gyro	the pilot attitude information
possibly in combination with the system vacuum that was not operating at the minimum required , would have resulted in the attitude gyro spinning at a speed considerably below the value required for proper stabilization	the autopilot to become unusable , while the subsequent toppling of the gyro deprived the pilot of attitude information
The extreme aft C of G loading of the aircraft	the elevator sensitivity of an aircraft known for its light elevator control forces
The extreme aft C of G loading of the aircraft increased the elevator sensitivity of an aircraft known for its light elevator control forces	the aircraft 's longitudinal stability
This decrease in stability	an increase in pilot workload
Any nose-down divergence from level flight would continue to increase the angle of dive or spiral	a very high airspeed excursion within a very short period of time
The constant ground speed indicates that the pilot was maintaining a high cruise speed for several minutes as he attempted to maintain control before entering the spiral	the margin before the speeds and
this	the in-flight breakup
In this occurrence , there were several organizational and human performance deficiencies	the occurrence chain of events
The pilot had not practised partial panel instrument flying for a number of years	transition a partial panel situation
These two factors	the aircraft more difficult to handle due to an increase of the aircraft 's pitch control sensitivity and a reduction of longitudinal stability
this	the in-flight breakup
this	the risk a hazard could go undetected
Lack of adequate instrument	the risk of loss of control in single-pilot instrument flight rules -LRB- IFR -RRB- aircraft operations
a lower speed	a greater margin maximum operating speed -LRB- Vmo -RRB- while manoeuvring
