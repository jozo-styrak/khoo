the speed had not increased beyond stall -LRB- the slap mark made by the airspeed indicator 's pointer at impact was at 40 knots -RRB- and there was no damage to the trees around the aircraft at the accident site	it is concluded that the aircraft stalled close to the tree tops
the aircraft was found pointed downhill and opposite to the expected route of flight , it is likely that the stall occurred when the pilot was reversing course while flying up the valley at low level	Also ,
most general aviation aircraft are not equipped with linear stall warning devices such as angle of attack indicators	pilots may not always be aware of how close to stalling the aircraft they are
visual illusions and the lack of a linear stall warning device	It is possible that both pilots were lulled into a false sense of security
The wreckage examination	no evidence of mechanical control problems
the airspeed indicator 's pointer at impact was at 40 knots	the slap mark
they had	a practice landing
optical illusions	their realization of the rising terrain
In this accident , the horn would not likely have sounded early enough	either pilot time take action to avoid the stall
the experience level of the pilot flying	the pilot-in-command to be less vigilant
pilots continue	their decisions
