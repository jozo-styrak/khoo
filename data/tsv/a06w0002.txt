the fuel selector was closed as per the subsequent Engine Securing Checklist	the fuel flow stopped
the fuel selector had been turned off as part of the initial Engine Fire Checklist	the fire have been extinguished earlier
the different expansion rates of materials	The fuel line assembly of metal tubing , rubber hose couplings , and hose clamps increased the possibility of leaks
fire damage in the accessory section	This would be consistent with the loss of hydraulic pressure in the gear retraction system
this aircraft been operating at a higher gross weight	the power loss from two engines , combined with the additional drag from the extended main gear , may have precluded a return to the airport , or resulted in an in-flight loss of control
turning the fuel selector off is not required as part of the primary Engine Fire Checklist	The fuel-fed fire burned for an extended period of time
The fuel line assembly of metal tubing , rubber hose couplings , and hose clamps	the possibility of leaks due to the different expansion rates of materials
Investigation as per the troubleshooting chart in the maintenance manual	the fuel pressure line leakage
A fuel leak from the main fuel inlet line in the engine compartment of this cargo DC-4	an in-flight fire spread into the nacelle and wing
