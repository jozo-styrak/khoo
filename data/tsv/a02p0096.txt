of the illuminated generator warning light could not be determined	The generator light could also have illuminated had the generator ceased to operate because of low engine rpm -LRB- below about 40 % Ng -RRB- , or as a result of fuselage break-up at impact with the terrain
it entered cloud	He did not have an instrument rating , and the helicopter was not equipped with an artificial horizon instrument or a stabilization system , greatly increasing the risk that the pilot lose control of the helicopter
the pilot , for unknown reasons , allowed the rotor rpm to decrease to the point where the helicopter could no longer be controlled	Loss of control could also occur
low engine rpm -LRB- below about 40 % Ng -RRB- , or as a result of fuselage break-up at impact with the terrain	The generator light could also have illuminated had the generator ceased to operate
the main rotor rpm dropped below approximately 50 % , as could be the case during the rotor impacts with the trees and the ground	The transmission oil pressure light illuminate
the rotor rpm dropped below 92 % , either before or after the pilot lost control	The rotor low rpm light would illuminate
it was higher during initial contact with the trees	contact , although there are indications
The permanent mounting position of the ELT on this helicopter exposed the unit to severe	forces which rendered it ineffective
the ELT been mounted in an area which was less vulnerable to impact	it may have survived the accident and assisted the SAR efforts in locating the wreckage sooner
He did not have an instrument rating , and the helicopter was not equipped with an artificial horizon instrument or a stabilization system	the risk the pilot would lose control of the helicopter if it entered cloud
Loss of control could also occur because the pilot , for unknown reasons	the rotor rpm decrease to the point where the helicopter could no longer be controlled
In either case , it is apparent that the helicopter was not high enough	control be recovered before tree/ground impact
during the initial impacts with the trees/ground	the switches to activate the lights
the rotor blades contacting the ground immediately before impact	coning and high blade pitch angle
The lack of an ELT signal	the SAR efforts quickly detecting and locating the wreckage
weather conditions	this occurrence could not be determined
