the additional radio traffic from the activities of the extra pad	The UHF was more congested than normal
the increased activity and the radio congestion	the driver/operator of beta truck 13 was unable to effectively establish radio communication with the ZDC to advise that he was still in position in front of the aircraft
Several factors created the unsafe situation	the occurrence
Several factors	the unsafe situation that led to the occurrence
the number of aircraft	the effectiveness of CDF operations
Extraneous comments and conversations over the UHF radio	the congestion of an already busy frequency
This increased activity	task saturation and frequency congestion for the ZDC
Standard operating procedures at the central de-icing facility -LRB- CDF -RRB-	one ZDC overseeing more than three de-icing pads at a time
This lack of qualification	UHF radio discipline , which did not meet an acceptable standard for safe operations at the CDF
