there was no flight data recorder or cockpit voice recorder	other data -LRB- such as precise airspeed , g load , autopilot status , and position of the flight controls and control column -RRB- could not be determined
an in-flight	overstress but could also have occurred during the ground impact
the two wings	The fact that the left wing failed before the right may be
An in-flight event capable of loading the left wing beyond its design strength	permanent deformation
the severe structural damage caused to the aircraft during the break-up and the ground impact	the more subtle indications of overstress
Radio communications from the pilot , including the final clipped transmission	no indication of a significant g load
at a higher airspeed	the probability that the aircraft will encounter a structurally damaging gust
Portions of the left wing struck the empennage	the empennage to also separate in flight
