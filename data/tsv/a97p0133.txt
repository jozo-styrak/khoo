the use of the published hand-off guidelines	in general , is not considered essential , controllers consider the mental checklist to be adequate
there were no other visual cues or job aids at the coordinator 's work station that could highlight the fact that the coordination had not been completed	the incoming coordinator was forced to rely on the memory and thoroughness of the departing controller to update him on the expected activity out of Boundary Bay airport
he was now controlling that aircraft , he decided to monitor the situation and deal with any conflicts as they may develop	However ,
he had not been informed that an IFR aircraft would be entering his airspace , he concluded that the aircraft was a VFR flight , operating above the Boundary Bay control zone	However ,
ensuring	that CDR1360 passed behind the Cessna 172
a minimum of 500 feet of vertical spacing had been assured by the clearance and because CDR1360 passed behind and clear of the departing Cessna 172	A loss of separation did occur , but there was no risk of collision
the outgoing coordinator relied on a mental checklist during the hand-off briefing to the incoming coordinator	essential information regarding the Cessna 172 was omitted

This type of situation	a passive rather than active transfer of information
This type of situation results in a passive rather than active transfer of information	defences rely on redundancy , and increases the risk of error

Based on a compelling mental model that the Cessna 172 was operating under VFR , the arrival controller provided an approach clearance to CDR1360	the aircraft to descend to 2,500 feet
the arrival controller	an approach clearance CDR1360
altitude	a minimum spacing of 500 feet between the inbound IFR flight
The arrival controller believed that the Cessna 172 was operating VFR and issued a clearance to CDR1360	the spacing between the aircraft to be to nm and about 500 feet
