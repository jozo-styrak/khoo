The pilot-owner was aware that he should pay particular attention to the ailerons because maintenance work had been done on them	, his decision to be supervised by a more experienced pilot was reasonable since he had not flown for more than three months
This was not the AME 's first time installing an aileron bell crank assembly	, he elected to perform the work from memory without checking each step in the maintenance manual
The independent inspection made by another aircraft maintenance engineer -LRB- AME -RRB- did not reveal the reversed aileron controls	, a defective aircraft was returned to service
The AME elected to perform the work from memory instead of using the microfiches	, a check was not made when the aileron controls were reassembled
maintenance work had been done on them	The pilot-owner was aware that he should pay particular attention to the ailerons
they had paid closer attention to the deflection of the aileron relative to the deflection of the flight controls during the walk-around inspection , the engine warm-up , and the before take-off check	Although that checklist was not followed , the pilots have noticed the problem
the many rusted screws that made the work more difficult	The work took much longer
the poor appearance of the bell cranks	he elected to remove them from the wing to clean them
he was accustomed to doing this kind of work	the AME did not have to check the aileron deflection or movement with the diagram
he removed the bell cranks from the wing	he should have checked the deflection as indicated in the maintenance manual
the AME had followed the maintenance manual procedures	the error have been prevented
installing the aileron bell cranks were not followed , resulting in an error when the bell cranks were reinstalled	The procedures described in the manufacturer 's maintenance manual
The work took much longer because of the many rusted screws	the work more difficult
another aircraft maintenance engineer -LRB- AME -RRB-	inspection
The procedures described in the manufacturer 's maintenance manual for installing the aileron bell cranks were not followed	an error
