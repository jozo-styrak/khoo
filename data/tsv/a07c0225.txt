bonding	with and reducing the freezing point of the water
The higher fuel temperatures associated with the inside storage of the aircraft would have increased the fuel 's saturation level	a higher amount of water held in suspension
The higher fuel temperatures associated with the inside storage of the aircraft	the fuel 's saturation level
the exposure of the valve directly to the cold airstream	the freezing of super-cooled water droplets present in the fuel stream

This blocked the fuel supply to the fuel nozzles	the loss of engine power
This blocked the fuel supply to the fuel nozzles	the loss of engine power
Use of such an additive would have inhibited ice formation in the aircraft 's fuel system	the fuel system blockage
The fuel distributor valve on the Aero Commander 500B is exposed directly to the cooling blast of the outside air , which under extremely cold conditions	the freezing of super-cooled water droplets present in the fuel stream
