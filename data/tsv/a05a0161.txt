the reduced distance to fly to reach Runway 14	This change required the crew to re-program the FMS , conduct another approach briefing for Runway 14 , and also expedite the descent
nor carry out a pilot monitored approach -LRB- PMA -RRB- , which disabled a critical safety defence established by the company to effectively manage low-visibility conditions	The crew did not brief
the aircraft was being manoeuvred to correct the situation	the aircraft wing contacted the runway
limited experience	type and the relatively high-stress , high-workload environment , exacerbated by the dark , low-visibility conditions
he believed that the co-pilot was correcting back toward the centre of the runway and the landing was salvageable	The captain did not take control or command a go-around after the transition became destabilized
The crew did not carry out a pilot monitored approach in accordance with company procedures	disabled a critical safety defence established to manage landing safely in the low-visibility conditions
his limited experience	type and the stress from the low-visibility and relatively high-workload conditions
the cockpit voice recorder -LRB- CVR -RRB- was not shut down after it was determined that the aircraft wing had struck the ground , depriving the investigation team of possible important information	Significant data were lost to the investigation
This anticipation was	the ACARS reports from the operator 's dispatch and the ATIS information at Halifax

All of these elements increased the crew workload	the inadvertent omission of the required monitored approach procedure
All of these elements	the crew workload
Flying a PMA	the more experienced flight crew member landing the aircraft in the reduced visibility conditions

The touchdown position , in conjunction with the delay in the application of reverse thrust	the aircraft slowing to taxi speed with only approximately 500 feet of runway remaining
The fact that the CVR continued to operate after the aircraft landed	occurrence information
The fact that the CVR continued to operate after the aircraft landed resulted in occurrence information being overwritten	the investigation team potentially important information relative to the occurrence
The transition from the approach to the landing phase became destabilized when the co-pilot disconnected the autopilot	the aircraft wing contacting the runway when the aircraft was being manoeuvred to correct the situation
The touchdown point , in conjunction with the delay in application of reverse thrust	the risk of a runway overrun
Significant data were lost to the investigation because the cockpit voice recorder -LRB- CVR -RRB- was not shut down after it was determined that the aircraft wing had struck the ground	the investigation team possible important information
