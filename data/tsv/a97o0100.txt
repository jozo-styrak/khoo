New flight crew members take time to adjust to operating procedures and the flow of task completion	, the experienced crew member must be rigid in adherence to procedures and vigilant to all operations in the cockpit , all of which increase the workload on the experienced member

The increased workload contributed to the breakdown in coordination and communication	the before landing check not being completed
The increased workload	the breakdown in coordination and communication and resulted in the before landing check not being completed

The final link in the chain of events	the occurrence was the failure of the landing gear warning horn to warn the pilots that the landing gear was not locked down
prior to its undertaking	an increased workload for both crew members
