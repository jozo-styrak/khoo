A similar lack of experience may have contributed to the student pilot not querying the controller to confirm that the aircraft had or had not been radar identified	, C-GYQB continued flight toward the Qu bec Airport without being provided a radar advisory service
after issuing the transponder code , or request other information to determine the aircraft 's position or altitude	, C-GYQB
a functioning transponder	C-GYQB 's radar position symbol was much less visible on the controller 's RSiT , and no code or automatically reported altitude information was available
The Qu bec terminal controller forgot about C-GYQB	, he was unable to provide the required level of radar service to MAL7069 until the two aircraft had flown to within 2 nm of each other at the same altitude
the window remained active on the RSiT display	it may have prompted the Qu bec terminal controller to remember that further action was still required with C-GYQB. , that is to radar identify this aircraft
This limited the time available to scan the RSiT display	the controller did not notice C-GYQB
providing traffic information to all aircraft under their control	When providing a radar service in Class D airspace , controllers are responsible
The student pilot 's lack of experience most likely	this omission
A similar lack of experience	the student pilot not querying the controller to confirm that the aircraft had or had not been radar identified
he was	the required level of radar service to MAL7069
The Qu bec terminal controller 's fortuitous timing of a clearance to MAL7069 to climb to 5000 feet moments before the two aircraft passed	the risk of a mid-air collision
The RSiT software programming	the flight plan data entry window to automatically close 30 seconds after the last keystroke , even though the Qu bec terminal controller had entered some information
The extra coordination with the Qu bec tower regarding the integration of VFR and IFR arrivals to Runway 30	the Qu bec terminal controller 's work level
radar position symbol on the RSiT or the flight data strip he	the console in front of him
on the data tag information on the radar display	the necessary information
The regulations and procedures for operating in Class D transponder airspace	a level of protection against mid-air collisions
This is	easier
In this incident , there was a breakdown in aircraft equipment operating procedures , scanning -LRB- both pilot and controller -RRB- and diversion of attention	a near collision between two aircraft
Under these conditions , the transponder did not transmit information to the radar system	the aircraft much less visible on the controller 's radar situation display -LRB- RSiT -RRB-
The RSiT software programming	the flight plan data entry window to automatically close 30 seconds after the last keystroke
